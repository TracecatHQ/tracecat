          <Context>
          You are an expert at AWS security remediation.
          You must generate specific AWS CLI commands using actual values from the alert.
          Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_remediate.html
          </Context>

          <Task>
          Generate remediation steps with AWS CLI commands based on this GuardDuty finding.
          Each command MUST:
          1. Use or reference ACTUAL values from the alert. (e.g. real instance IDs, IP addresses)
          2. Include a clear explanation of what it does
          3. Note any potential impact or risk
          4. Follow AWS security best practices
          Your tone should be actionable and concise as a user will be executing these commands.
          </Task>

          You may consult the following AWS documentation from the GuardDuty user guide to help you generate the remediation steps:
          <RemediationSteps>
            <Kind>Remediating a potentially compromised Amazon EC2 instance</Kind>
            <Brief>When GuardDuty generates finding types that indicate potentially compromised Amazon EC2 resources, then your Resource will be Instance. Potential finding types could be EC2 finding types, GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring finding types, or Malware Protection for EC2 finding types. If the behavior that caused the finding was expected in your environment, then consider using Suppression rules.</Brief>
            <Step number="1">
                <Title>Identify the potentially compromised Amazon EC2 instance</Title>
                <Description>
                    Investigate the instance for malware and remove any discovered malware. Utilize GuardDuty's on-demand malware scan or explore AWS Marketplace for partner products to assist in malware identification and removal.

            </Step>
            <Step number="2">
                <Title>Isolate the potentially compromised Amazon EC2 instance</Title>
                <Description>
                    If feasible, follow these steps to isolate the instance:
                    <SubStep number="2.1">
                        <Title>Create a dedicated Isolation security group</Title>
                        <Description>
                            This group should permit inbound and outbound access only from specific IP addresses. Ensure no rules allow traffic to or from 0.0.0.0/0 over any port range (0-65535).
                        </Description>
                    </SubStep>
                    <SubStep number="2.2">
                        <Title>Associate the Isolation security group with the instance</Title>
                        <Description>
                            Attach the newly created Isolation security group to the compromised instance.
                        </Description>
                    </SubStep>
                    <SubStep number="2.3">
                        <Title>Remove other security group associations</Title>
                        <Description>
                            Detach all other security groups from the instance, leaving only the Isolation security group associated.
                        </Description>
                    </SubStep>
                    <Note>
                        Existing tracked connections won't be terminated by changing security groups; only future traffic will be blocked by the new security group. For more details, refer to the Amazon EC2 User Guide on security group connection tracking.
                    </Note>
                </Description>
            </Step>
            <Step number="3">
                <Title>Identify the source of the suspicious activity</Title>
                <Description>
                    If malware is detected, determine and halt any unauthorized activities on the instance. This may involve actions like closing open ports, modifying access policies, and updating applications to fix vulnerabilities. If these measures don't resolve the issue, consider terminating the compromised instance and replacing it as necessary. Additional resources for securing EC2 instances include:
