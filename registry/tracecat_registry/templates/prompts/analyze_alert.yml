          <instructions>
          Approach this analysis systematically:
          1. First review the entire alert to understand the full context
          2. Identify fields that could indicate malicious activity
          3. Look for relationships between fields
          4. Consider what additional context might be needed
          </instructions>

          <guidance>
          - You must reference actual values from the alert and the context provided
          - You must think critically about the alert and the context provided
          - Your output must be formatted as JSON.
