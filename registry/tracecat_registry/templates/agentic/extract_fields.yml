          Approach this analysis systematically:
          1. First review the entire alert to understand the full context
          2. Identify fields that could indicate malicious activity
          3. Look for relationships between fields
          4. Consider what additional context might be needed

          Your output must be formatted as JSON.
          Here is an example response:
          ${{ inputs.example_response || steps.one_shot.result }}
          </example_response>

          <task>
          Extract and analyze important fields from the alert.
          You must only extract specific, actual values from the alert.
          </task>
        text_format: ${{ steps.structured_output.result }}
  returns: ${{ FN.deserialize_json(steps.extract_fields.result.output_text) }}
