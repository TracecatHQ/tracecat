_Disclaimer: Tracecat is currently in public beta. If you'd like to use Tracecat in production, please reach out to us on Discord or founders@tracecat.com!_
_Want to take Tracecat for a spin? Try out our [tutorials](https://docs.tracecat.com/quickstart) with [Tracecat Cloud](https://platform.tracecat.com) or [self-hosted](https://docs.tracecat.com/installation)._

[Tracecat](https://tracecat.com) is an open source automation platform for security teams. We're building the features of Tines / Splunk SOAR with enterprise-grade open source tools.

It's designed to be simple but powerful. Security automation should be accessible to everyone, ~~including~~ especially understaffed small-to-mid sized teams.

Check out our [quickstart](https://docs.tracecat.com/quickstart) and build your first AI workflow in 15 minutes.
The easiest way to get started is to sign-up for [Tracecat Cloud](https://platform.tracecat.com).
We also support [self-hosted](https://docs.tracecat.com/installation) Tracecat.

> [!NOTE]
> SOAR [(Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/security-orchestration-automation-response-soar) refers to technologies that enable organizations to automatically collect and respond to alerts across different security tooling (e.g. Crowdstrike, Microsoft Defender, SIEM) and data sources (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Okta system logs).

## Getting started

Let's automate a phishing email investigation, collect evidence, and generate a remediation plan using AI.
You can follow the [tutorial here](https://docs.tracecat.com/quickstart).

Tracecat is **not** a 1-to-1 mapping of Tines / Splunk SOAR. Our aim is to give technical teams a Tines-like experience, but with a focus on open source, alerts triage, unified APIs, and AI features.

## Installation

Tracecat is Cloud agnostic and deploys anywhere that supports Docker.
Learn how to [install Tracecat locally](https://docs.tracecat.com/installation).

- [x] Docker Compose
- [x] AWS
- [ ] Azure
- [ ] GCP

## Status

- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [tracecat.com](https://tracecat.com) but go easy on us, there are kinks and we are just getting started.
- [x] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enteprise use-cases
- [ ] Public: Production-ready

We're currently in Public Alpha.
