# Contributing to Tracecat

Tracecat is currently accepting contributions for:
- **Action Templates** and **Python integrations** in [Tracecat Registry](https://docs.tracecat.com/integrations/overview)
- **Inline functions** for Tracecat's [expressions](https://docs.tracecat.com/quickstart/expressions) engine

**Tracecat Registry** is a collection of integration and response-as-code templates. Response actions, called **Action Templates**, are organized into [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) categories (detect, isolate, evict, restore, harden, model) and Tracecat's own ontology of capabilities (e.g. `list_alerts`, `list_cases`, `list_users`).
Template inputs (e.g. `start_time`, `end_time`) are normalized to fit the [Open Cyber Security Schema (OCSF)](https://schema.ocsf.io/) ontology where possible.

We have a growing open source community contributing normalized HTTP and Python client (e.g. `boto3`, `falconpy`) based integrations.
We hope you contribute to Tracecat, join our community of security / IT engineers :heart:, gain experience with a production code-base, and improve your work portfolio through open source!

You'll find us in the `#contributors` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/H4XZwsYzY4).

## Git workflow

Please create a [issue](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/issues) to collect feedback prior to opening up a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/pulls). If possible try to keep PRs scoped to one feature, and add tests for new features. We use the fork-based contribution model described by [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).
(In short: Fork the Tracecat repo and open a PR back from your fork into our `main` branch.)

We use the following branch naming convention: `{feat/fix}/{short-description}` e.g. `feat/jamf-lock-device-template`.

## Before you start

> [!NOTE]
> This is the same development setup used by the core Tracecat team.
> We use `uv`'s `pip` [interface](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/) to run tests in an isolated Python environment.
> The whole development environment takes less than 5 minutes to set up.

The Tracecat development environment consists of a:

- Tracecat git repository
- Local Docker Compose development stack
- `uv` Python 3.12 [virtual environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/)
- `tracecat` and `tracecat_registry` Python packages (as [editable packages](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html))
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) git hook manager
- [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) JavaScript package manager

To set this up, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
cd tracecat

# Create Python 3.12 virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12

# Install Tracecat and Tracecat Registry
# Python packages and dependencies into venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv pip install -e "tracecat_registry[cli] @ ./registry"

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv pip install pre-commit
uv run pre-commit install

# Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install --dir frontend
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can find `tracecat` and `tracecat_registry` Python dependencies under the `[project]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` sections in the [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/pyproject.toml) and [`registry/pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/registry/pyproject.toml) files.

You've now configured a development environment.
Let's now spin up the Tracecat development stack with the following command:

```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

You can now access the Tracecat UI at [http://localhost](http://localhost).
Updates to Python code in `tracecat/` and `registry/` are automatically reflected in the development stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you update `pyproject.toml` or `registry/pyproject.toml`, with new dependencies, you need to rebuild the Tracecat development stack:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml down
> docker compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml build --no-cache
> docker compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
> ```

## Run `pytest`

We use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for all Python tests.

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit  # Run backend (includes inline functions) tests
uv run pytest tests/registry  # Run registry (core actions, integrations) tests
```

## How to contribute?

We currently support contributions for new integrations and inline functions.

### YAML Action Templates

> [!TIP]
> You can find existing Action Templates in the [`registry/tracecat_registry/templates/`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates) directory.

Every **Action Template** must be a YAML file that:

- Follows Tracecat's template [schema](https://docs.tracecat.com/integrations/action-templates).
- Has `expects` with arguments that match a supported [**Response Schema**](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/schemas) (e.g. `list_alerts`, `list_cases`, `list_users`).
- All required arguments in the API call in `steps` are mapped to an argument in a Response Schema.
- No optional arguments in the API call in `steps` are specified, unless required by a Response Schema or satisfies one of the conditions below.

We support `expects` arguments that are not in the **Response Schema** as long as they satisfy one of the following conditions:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the following conditions are insufficient for your use-case, please check out the [Response Schemas](#response-schemas) contribution guide below.

- Is an argument relevant to the integration's core functionality (e.g. `channel` and `thread_ts` in Slack messaging APIs).
- Requires an API URL specific to the tenant (`base_url`).

These additional arguments can be added to the end of the `expects` section.
`base_url` must be the last argument in the `expects` section:

```yaml
base_url:
  type: str
  description: Base URL for the {integration_name} API
```

#### Naming conventions

Our naming convention is simple:
- `title` must be less than 5 words and only describe the action (i.e. does not include the integration name).
- `description` should be a single sentence that describes the action and includes the integration name.
- `namespace` must following the format `tools.{integration_name}`.
- If the integration wraps a Python client, the integration name is the name of the client (e.g. `tools.slack_sdk`, `tools.aws_boto3`, `tools.falconpy`).

For example:
- `title`: List alerts
- `description`: Query for Crowdstrike alerts via the Falcon SIEM API.
- `namespace`: `tools.crowdstrike`

### Testing

Though we run tests in GitHub Actions, we highly recommend testing locally to speed up development.
You can do this by running:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/registry
```

#### Example template

```yaml
type: action
definition:
title: Lock device
description: Lock a device managed by Jamf Pro with a user-provided 6-digit pin.
display_group: Jamf
doc_url: https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/reference/post_v2-mdm-commands
namespace: tools.jamf
name: lock_device
expects:
  device_id:
    type: str
    description: Management ID of the device to lock.
  message:
    type: str
    description: Message to display on the device.
  pin:
    type: str
    description: 6-digit PIN to lock and unlock the device.
  base_url:
    type: str
    description: Base URL for the Jamf Pro API.
steps:
  - ref: get_access_token
    action: tools.jamf.get_access_token
    args:
      base_url: ${{ inputs.base_url }}
  - ref: post_mdm_command
    action: core.http_request
    args:
      url: ${{ inputs.base_url }}/api/v2/mdm/commands
      method: POST
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer ${{ steps.get_access_token.result }}
      payload:
        clientData:
          managementId: ${{ inputs.device_id }}
        commandData:
          commandType: DEVICE_LOCK
          message: ${{ inputs.message }}
          pin: ${{ inputs.pin }}
returns: ${{ steps.post_mdm_command.result }}
```

### Response Schemas

> [!TIP]
> You can find existing YAML schemas in the [`registry/tracecat_registry/schemas/`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/schemas) directory.

If you can't find a schema that matches your integration or want to suggest a change to an existing schema, please [open an issue](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/issues). Provide the following information:

- Link to the closest [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) category (e.g. `detect`, `isolate`, `evict`, `restore`, `harden`, `model`).
- Links to the relevant [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io/) classes and objects.
- Links to any similar or related schemas in Tracecat Registry.
- (If applicable) Suggested name of the new capability (e.g. `list_alerts`, `list_cases`, `list_users`)

### Inline Functions

> [!TIP]
> You can find existing inline functions in the [`tracecat/expressions/functions.py`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/tracecat/expressions/functions.py) file.

Please add tests for the new inline function.
You can find the tests in the [`tests/unit/test_functions.py`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/tests/unit/test_functions.py) file.

To run the tests in isolation, use the following command:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_functions.py -x --last-failed
```

> [!NOTE]
> - `-x` flag stops the tests at the first failure
> - `--last-failed` option re-runs all tests that failed in the previous run

### Python Integrations

> [!TIP]
> You can find existing Python integrations in the [`registry/tracecat_registry/integrations/`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/integrations) directory.
