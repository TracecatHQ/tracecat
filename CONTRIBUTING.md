# Contributing to Tracecat

Please create an issue to collect feedback prior to feature additions. If possible try to keep PRs scoped to one feature, and add tests for new features. We use the fork-based contribution model described by [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).
(In short: Fork the Tracecat repo and open a PR back from your fork into our default branch.)

We use the following branch naming convention: `{feat/fix}/{short-description}` e.g. `feat/jamf-lock-device-template`.
Please
