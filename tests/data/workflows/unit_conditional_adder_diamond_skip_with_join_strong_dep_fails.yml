title: Adder diamond skip with join with strong depedency
#    A
#    /\
#   B  [C] <- C should not run
#    \ /
#     D <- D should fail, because it tries to access C's result
description: |
  Initial conditions:
  - C fails
  - D has a strong dependency on C, meaning it's both structurally dependent and data dependent

  Expect:
  - Condition returns false
  - C does not run
  - D fails
