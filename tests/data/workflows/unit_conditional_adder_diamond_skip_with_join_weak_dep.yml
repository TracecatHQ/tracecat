title: Adder diamond skip with join with weak depedency
#    A
#    /\
#   B  [C] <- C should not run
#    \ /
#     D <- D should still run, because it is not entirely dependent on C
description: |
  Initial conditions:
  - C fails
  - D has a weak dependency on C, meaning it's only structurally dependent but not data dependent

  Expect:
  - Condition returns false
  - C does not run
  - D still runs
