# This sample workflow executes 3 steps in sequence.
# 1) activity1, takes arg1 as input, and put result as result1.
# 2) it runs a parallel block which runs below sequence branches in parallel
#  2.1) sequence 1
#    2.1.1) activity2, takes result1 as input, and put result as result2
#    2.1.2) activity3, takes arg2 and result2 as input, and put result as result3
#  2.2) sequence 2
#    2.2.1) activity4, takes result1 as input, and put result as result4
#    2.2.2) activity5, takes arg3 and result4 as input, and put result as result5
# 3) activity6, takes result3 and result5 as input, and put result as result6.
