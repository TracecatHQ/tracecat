"""Tracecat identifiers module.


Thinking
--------
- Consistent and meaningful identifiers are important for traceability and debugging.
- The identifiers should be unique and easy to generate.
- The identifiers should be human-readable and easy to understand.


Resource Classes
----------------
All ideantifiers should be prefixed with a short **resource class identifier** to avoid conflicts.
We use:
- `act` for actions
- `wf` for workflow runs
- `user` for users
- `org` for organizations
- `secret` for secrets

etc.
Try to keep identifier segments under 5 characters.


Convention
----------
All resource IDs are constructed by their resource class prefix followed by a dash and a unique hex string.
e.g. act-77932a0b140a4465a1a25a5c95edcfb8

Resource classes may have alternative identifiers to their IDs.
An example would be action references and keys:
- Action references: used as a convenient way to refer to an action in a workflow,
- Action keys: used as an alternative unique identifier for an action.

Resources may have related or hierarchical identifiers that depend on other resources.
For example, a workflow run ID may depend on the workflow ID:
e.g. wf-77932a0b140a4465a1a25a5c95edcfb8:run-b140a425a577932a0c95edcfb8465a1a
