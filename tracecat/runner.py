"""Workflow runner.

Data flow
---------
1. User creates a workflow graph in the client.
2. On submission, the client sends the graph (nodes and edges with data) to a pool of runners
3. A runner receives the graph and stores it in memory.


Invariants
----------
- Runners can accept and execute multiple arbitrary workflows until completion.

Workflows and workflow runs
----------------------------
- A workflow is a graph of actions.
- A run is an instance of a workflow.

Actions and action runs
-----------------------
- An action is a node in the graph.
- A run is an instance of an action.

Stores
------
- We need to store the state of the workflow run.
- The current implementation uses in-memory kv stores to manage execution state.
- We can use distributed kv stores / databases to manage state across multiple runners to scale the backend.
- Note that ActionRuns need to be identified across workflow runs - we use a combination of the workflow id and the action id to do this.

    Design
    ------
    - There are 2 ways to design this:
        1. Use a 'lazy' BFS traversal to traverse the graph, with as much concurrency as possible.
        2. Use something like `graphlib` to schedule all tasks eagerly.
    - We will use the lazy approach for various reasons:
        1. Compute efficiency: We only compute the next action when we need it.
        2. We can prune the graph as we go along, instead of having to cancel scheduled tasks along a certain path.
        3. We can infinitely suspend the workflow run and resume it later.

    Logic
    -----
    - If no entry point is passed, the workflow will start from the default entrypoint.
    - Beginning from the entrypoint, traverse the graph and execute each action.
    - Execute the action based on the action type.
    - Store the results of each action in the KV store.
    - On successful completion, enqueue the next actions.
        - We must pass the results of the previous action to the next action
        - This will allow us to trace the lineage of the data.
        - NOTE(perf): We can parallelize the execution of the next actions (IO bound).

    Thoughts on current design
    --------------------------
    - Maybe break this out into a pure workflow worker. I say this because we then won't have to
     associate the worker with a specific workflow.
    - The `start_workflow` function can then just directly enqueue the first action.
