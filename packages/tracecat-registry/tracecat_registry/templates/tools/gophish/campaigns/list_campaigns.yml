    # This is needed because the API will return results and timelines for all campaigns. This can exceed the max size of workflow data steps very easily. For example a campaign with 1,000 recipients will return 11,000 lines of just results, in addition to the at least 1000 timeline items which are each another 8 lines of data. Very quickly this can exceed the max size of workflow data steps.
