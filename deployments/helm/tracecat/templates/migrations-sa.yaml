{{/*
Dedicated ServiceAccount for the pre-install migration hook.

Regular chart resources (like serviceaccount.yaml) are created AFTER hooks,
so the migration job cannot use the main tracecat-app SA. This hook-based SA
is created at weight -10 (before the migration job at weight -5), ensuring
the SA exists when the migration pod is scheduled.
