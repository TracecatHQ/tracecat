## OAuth grant types

Tracecat supports two OAuth 2.0 grant types for different authentication scenarios:
- **Authorization Code Flow (Delegated User)**: OAuth flow where a human user is redirected to the provider to grant permissions.
- **Client Credentials Flow (Service Account)**: Machine to machine authentication using credentials only.

## Setting up OAuth integrations

Before configuring OAuth integrations in Tracecat, you must first create an OAuth application with your chosen provider (Microsoft, Google, GitHub, etc.).
This process is the same for both Authorization Code and Client Credentials flows:

1. **Create OAuth application** - Register a new application in your provider's developer console
2. **Configure redirect URI** - Set the callback URL that Tracecat will provide during setup
3. **Obtain credentials** - Copy the client ID and client secret from your OAuth application
4. **Set permissions** - Configure the required scopes and permissions for your use case

Each provider has specific setup requirements. Tracecat provides direct links to setup guides in the configuration interface for each OAuth integration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to integrations">
    Go to your workspace and navigate to the integrations page. Select the OAuth provider you want to configure from the available list. Each grant type is defined as a separate OAuth integration - you can distinguish between them by the lock icon (Client Credentials) or user icon (Authorization Code) displayed on each integration tile. This allows you to configure multiple integrations for the same provider with different grant types and credentials.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the provider">
    Configure the following settings for your selected provider:
    - **Client ID** - OAuth application client ID from the provider
    - **Client Secret** - OAuth application client secret (encrypted when saved)
    - **Additional Scopes** - Custom scopes beyond the base requirements (optional)

    <img src="/img/integrations/oauth/configure-provider.png" alt="OAuth provider configuration" />
    <Note>
      Each provider includes setup instructions with links to their developer documentation.
      Follow the provider's guide to create an OAuth application and obtain your client credentials.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete authentication">
    The authentication process depends on your selected grant type:

    **Authorization Code Flow**

    Click "Connect with OAuth" to complete the authorization:

    <img src="/img/integrations/oauth/ac-flow.png" alt="Authorization Code Flow" />

    This redirects you to the provider's authorization page where you grant permissions to Tracecat.

    **Client Credentials Flow**

    Click "Fetch Token" to verify your client credentials. No user authorization is required - the connection uses your application's credentials directly.

    <img src="/img/integrations/oauth/cc-flow.png" alt="Client Credentials Flow" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Once connected, the integration status shows as "Connected" with details about granted scopes and token expiration:

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing scopes

OAuth integrations use a two-tier scope system:

### Base scopes
Required permissions that every integration needs for basic functionality.
These are automatically included and cannot be removed.

### Additional scopes
Optional permissions you can add for extended functionality.
Use the scope input to add custom scopes beyond the base requirements.

<Tip>
  Only add scopes you actually need. Extra permissions increase security risk and may require additional approval from your organization.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Scope validation" icon="shield-check">
  Each provider defines allowed scope patterns to prevent invalid or potentially dangerous permissions.

  If you enter an invalid scope, you'll see a validation error with the expected patterns.

  Common validation patterns:
  - **Microsoft Graph**: `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` or specific resource scopes
  - **Google APIs**: Service-specific scopes like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
  - **GitHub**: Repository and organization permissions like `repo`, `read:org`
</Accordion>

## Integration status

OAuth integrations have three possible states:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Not configured">
    No client credentials have been set up. Click "Configure integration" to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configured">
    Client credentials are saved but authentication hasn't been completed:
    - For Authorization Code flow, click "Connect with OAuth".
    - For Client Credentials flow, click "Test connection".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connected">
    Successfully authenticated and ready to use in workflows. For Authorization Code flow, tokens are automatically refreshed as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing integrations

Once configured, you have two options for managing OAuth integrations:

### Disconnect
Removes the OAuth tokens while preserving your configuration (client ID, secret, and scopes). Use this when:
- You want to re-authenticate with different permissions
- The current authentication has issues but you want to keep the configuration
- You need to switch which account is connected

### Delete
Completely removes the integration including all configuration and tokens. Use this when:
- You no longer need the integration
- You want to set up with entirely different credentials
- You're switching to a different OAuth application

## Using in workflows

Once connected, OAuth integrations work seamlessly with action templates and Python UDFs.
The integration handles token retrieval automatically - no need to manage credentials in your workflows.

```yaml
# Example: List files from Microsoft OneDrive
- ref: list_files
  action: tools.microsoft_graph.list_drive_files
  args:
    drive_id: "b!abc123"
    folder_path: "/Documents"
```

The `tools.microsoft_graph.list_drive_files` action automatically uses your connected OAuth integration for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration shows as expired" icon="clock">
    OAuth tokens have limited lifespans. Tracecat automatically refreshes expired tokens using refresh tokens.

    If refresh fails, you may need to re-authorize by clicking "Connect with OAuth" again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scope permission errors" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    If workflows fail with permission errors, check that your integration includes the required scopes.

    You can update scopes in the configuration tab and re-authorize to grant additional permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider connection fails" icon="wifi-off">
    Verify your OAuth application configuration with the provider:
    - Redirect URI matches the one shown in Tracecat
    - Client ID and secret are correct
    - OAuth application is enabled and published
  </Accordion>
