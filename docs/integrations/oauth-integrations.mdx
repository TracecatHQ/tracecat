<Tip>
  OAuth integrations provide a secure way to connect to third-party services without exposing credentials in workflows or logs.
  All tokens are encrypted at rest and automatically refreshed when needed.
</Tip>


**OAuth integrations** are built-in connections to third-party services that handle the complete authentication flow automatically.
Unlike action templates that require manual token management, OAuth integrations provide seamless, secure access to external APIs.

Key benefits:
- **Secure credential storage** - Client secrets and tokens are encrypted at rest
- **Automatic token refresh** - Expired tokens are refreshed in the background
- **Dynamic scope management** - Configure only the permissions you need
- **Workspace isolation** - Each workspace has separate integration configurations

## OAuth grant types

Tracecat supports two OAuth 2.0 grant types for different authentication scenarios. The grant type must be selected when configuring each provider and affects both the authentication flow and available features.

### Authorization Code Flow
The standard OAuth flow where users are redirected to the provider to grant permissions. Best for:
- **User-delegated access** - Actions performed on behalf of a specific user
- **Interactive authentication** - Requires user consent and login
- **Broad API access** - Full access to user resources with appropriate scopes

Examples: Accessing a user's Microsoft OneDrive files, sending Slack messages as a specific user

### Client Credentials Flow
Direct machine-to-machine authentication using client credentials only. Best for:
- **Application-level access** - Actions performed by the application itself
- **Service authentication** - No user interaction required
- **System integration** - Background processes and automated workflows

Examples: Organization-wide Microsoft Teams channel management, system-level GitHub repository access

<Note>
  Each provider requires a specific grant type to be selected during configuration. This choice determines:
  - The authentication flow (user redirect vs direct authentication)
  - Available API permissions and scopes
  - Token refresh behavior
  
  Some providers support both flows while others may only support one. The provider's setup instructions will indicate which grant types are available.
</Note>

## Setting up OAuth integrations

### 1. Configure the provider

Navigate to the integrations page and select a provider to configure:

<img src="/images/oauth-setup-placeholder.png" alt="OAuth provider configuration" />

1. **Grant Type** - Select Authorization Code or Client Credentials flow
2. **Client ID** - OAuth application client ID from the provider
3. **Client Secret** - OAuth application client secret (encrypted when saved)
4. **Additional Scopes** - Custom scopes beyond the base requirements (optional)

<Note>
  Each provider includes setup instructions with links to their developer documentation.
  Follow the provider's guide to create an OAuth application and obtain your client credentials.
</Note>

### 2. Complete authentication

The authentication process depends on your selected grant type:

#### Authorization Code Flow
Click "Connect with OAuth" to complete the authorization:

<img src="/images/oauth-flow-placeholder.png" alt="OAuth authorization flow" />

This redirects you to the provider's authorization page where you grant permissions to Tracecat.

#### Client Credentials Flow
Click "Test Connection" to verify your client credentials. No user authorization is required - the connection uses your application's credentials directly.

### 3. Verify connection

Once connected, the integration status shows as "Connected" with details about granted scopes and token expiration:

<img src="/images/oauth-connected-placeholder.png" alt="Connected OAuth integration" />

## Managing scopes

OAuth integrations use a two-tier scope system:

### Base scopes
Required permissions that every integration needs for basic functionality.
These are automatically included and cannot be removed.

### Additional scopes
Optional permissions you can add for extended functionality.
Use the scope input to add custom scopes beyond the base requirements.

<Tip>
  Only add scopes you actually need. Extra permissions increase security risk and may require additional approval from your organization.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Scope validation" icon="shield-check">
  Each provider defines allowed scope patterns to prevent invalid or potentially dangerous permissions.

  If you enter an invalid scope, you'll see a validation error with the expected patterns.

  Common validation patterns:
  - **Microsoft Graph**: `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` or specific resource scopes
  - **Google APIs**: Service-specific scopes like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
  - **GitHub**: Repository and organization permissions like `repo`, `read:org`
</Accordion>

## Integration status

OAuth integrations have three possible states:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Not Configured">
    No client credentials have been set up. Click "Configure Integration" to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configured">
    Client credentials are saved but authentication hasn't been completed. For Authorization Code flow, click "Connect with OAuth". For Client Credentials flow, click "Test Connection".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connected">
    Successfully authenticated and ready to use in workflows. For Authorization Code flow, tokens are automatically refreshed as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing integrations

Once configured, you have two options for managing OAuth integrations:

### Disconnect
Removes the OAuth tokens while preserving your configuration (client ID, secret, and scopes). Use this when:
- You want to re-authenticate with different permissions
- The current authentication has issues but you want to keep the configuration
- You need to switch which account is connected

### Delete
Completely removes the integration including all configuration and tokens. Use this when:
- You no longer need the integration
- You want to set up with entirely different credentials
- You're switching to a different OAuth application

</Note>

## Using in workflows

Once connected, OAuth integrations work seamlessly with action templates and Python UDFs.
The integration handles token retrieval automatically - no need to manage credentials in your workflows.

```yaml
# Example: List files from Microsoft OneDrive
- ref: list_files
  action: tools.microsoft_graph.list_drive_files
  args:
    drive_id: "b!abc123"
    folder_path: "/Documents"
```

The `tools.microsoft_graph.list_drive_files` action automatically uses your connected OAuth integration for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration shows as expired" icon="clock">
    OAuth tokens have limited lifespans. Tracecat automatically refreshes expired tokens using refresh tokens.

    If refresh fails, you may need to re-authorize by clicking "Connect with OAuth" again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scope permission errors" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    If workflows fail with permission errors, check that your integration includes the required scopes.

    You can update scopes in the configuration tab and re-authorize to grant additional permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider connection fails" icon="wifi-off">
    Verify your OAuth application configuration with the provider:
    - Redirect URI matches the one shown in Tracecat
    - Client ID and secret are correct
    - OAuth application is enabled and published
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security considerations

<Warning>
  OAuth integrations have access to external services with the permissions you grant.
  Follow security best practices:

  - Only grant minimum required scopes
  - Regularly review connected integrations
  - Rotate client secrets periodically
  - Monitor integration usage in audit logs
</Warning>

All OAuth credentials and tokens are encrypted using workspace-specific encryption keys.
Tokens are never logged or exposed in workflow outputs for security.
