<Tip>
  OAuth integrations provide a secure way to connect to third-party services without exposing credentials in workflows or logs.
  All tokens are encrypted at rest and automatically refreshed when needed.
</Tip>


**OAuth integrations** are built-in connections to third-party services that handle the complete authentication flow automatically.
Unlike action templates that require manual token management, OAuth integrations provide seamless, secure access to external APIs.

Key benefits:
- **Secure credential storage** - Client secrets and tokens are encrypted at rest
- **Automatic token refresh** - Expired tokens are refreshed in the background
- **Dynamic scope management** - Configure only the permissions you need
- **Workspace isolation** - Each workspace has separate integration configurations

## OAuth grant types

Tracecat supports two OAuth 2.0 grant types for different authentication scenarios:

### Authorization Code Flow
The standard OAuth flow where users are redirected to the provider to grant permissions. Best for:
- **User-delegated access** - Actions performed on behalf of a specific user
- **Interactive authentication** - Requires user consent and login
- **Broad API access** - Full access to user resources with appropriate scopes

Examples: Accessing a user's Microsoft OneDrive files, sending Slack messages as a specific user

### Client Credentials Flow
Direct machine-to-machine authentication using client credentials only. Best for:
- **Application-level access** - Actions performed by the application itself
- **Service authentication** - No user interaction required
- **System integration** - Background processes and automated workflows

Examples: Organization-wide Microsoft Teams channel management, system-level GitHub repository access

<Note>
  The grant type is configured per provider and determines the authentication flow and available permissions.
  Some providers support both flows while others may only support one.
</Note>

## Setting up OAuth integrations

### 1. Configure the provider

Navigate to the integrations page and select a provider to configure:

<img src="/images/oauth-setup-placeholder.png" alt="OAuth provider configuration" />

1. **Grant Type** - Select Authorization Code or Client Credentials flow
2. **Client ID** - OAuth application client ID from the provider
3. **Client Secret** - OAuth application client secret (encrypted when saved)
4. **Additional Scopes** - Custom scopes beyond the base requirements (optional)

<Note>
  Each provider includes setup instructions with links to their developer documentation.
  Follow the provider's guide to create an OAuth application and obtain your client credentials.
</Note>

### 2. Complete authentication

The authentication process depends on your selected grant type:

#### Authorization Code Flow
Click "Connect with OAuth" to complete the authorization:

<img src="/images/oauth-flow-placeholder.png" alt="OAuth authorization flow" />

This redirects you to the provider's authorization page where you grant permissions to Tracecat.

#### Client Credentials Flow
Click "Test Connection" to verify your client credentials. No user authorization is required - the connection uses your application's credentials directly.

### 3. Verify connection

Once connected, the integration status shows as "Connected" with details about granted scopes and token expiration:

## Managing scopes

OAuth integrations use a two-tier scope system:

### Base scopes
Required permissions that every integration needs for basic functionality.
These are automatically included and cannot be removed.

### Additional scopes
Optional permissions you can add for extended functionality.
Use the scope input to add custom scopes beyond the base requirements.

<Tip>
  Only add scopes you actually need. Extra permissions increase security risk and may require additional approval from your organization.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Scope validation" icon="shield-check">
  Each provider defines allowed scope patterns to prevent invalid or potentially dangerous permissions.

  If you enter an invalid scope, you'll see a validation error with the expected patterns.

  Common validation patterns:
  - **Microsoft Graph**: `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` or specific resource scopes
  - **Google APIs**: Service-specific scopes like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
  - **GitHub**: Repository and organization permissions like `repo`, `read:org`
</Accordion>

## Integration status

OAuth integrations have three possible states:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Not Configured">
    No client credentials have been set up. Click "Configure Integration" to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configured">
    Client credentials are saved but authentication hasn't been completed. For Authorization Code flow, click "Connect with OAuth". For Client Credentials flow, click "Test Connection".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connected">
    Successfully authenticated and ready to use in workflows. For Authorization Code flow, tokens are automatically refreshed as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Note>

## Using in workflows

Once connected, OAuth integrations work seamlessly with action templates and Python UDFs.
The integration handles token retrieval automatically - no need to manage credentials in your workflows.

```yaml
# Example: List files from Microsoft OneDrive
- ref: list_files
  action: tools.microsoft_graph.list_drive_files
  args:
    drive_id: "b!abc123"
    folder_path: "/Documents"
```

The `tools.microsoft_graph.list_drive_files` action automatically uses your connected OAuth integration for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration shows as expired" icon="clock">
    OAuth tokens have limited lifespans. Tracecat automatically refreshes expired tokens using refresh tokens.

    If refresh fails, you may need to re-authorize by clicking "Connect with OAuth" again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scope permission errors" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    If workflows fail with permission errors, check that your integration includes the required scopes.

    You can update scopes in the configuration tab and re-authorize to grant additional permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider connection fails" icon="wifi-off">
    Verify your OAuth application configuration with the provider:
    - Redirect URI matches the one shown in Tracecat
    - Client ID and secret are correct
    - OAuth application is enabled and published
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security considerations

<Warning>
  OAuth integrations have access to external services with the permissions you grant.
  Follow security best practices:

  - Only grant minimum required scopes
  - Regularly review connected integrations
  - Rotate client secrets periodically
  - Monitor integration usage in audit logs
</Warning>

All OAuth credentials and tokens are encrypted using workspace-specific encryption keys.
Tokens are never logged or exposed in workflow outputs for security.
