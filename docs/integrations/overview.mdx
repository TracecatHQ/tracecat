<Tip>
  All integrations are open source in the [Tracecat GitHub repository](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat).

  - View YAML action templates [here](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates).
  - View Python integrations [here](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/integrations).

## What is Tracecat Registry?

**Tracecat Registry** is a collection of community-driven integrations and response actions in both YAML and Python.
The majority of integrations are written in YAML as **Action Templates**, which are reusable building blocks for response automation.

All integrations can be found under the `tools` namespace with the following naming convention in lower snake case:

```
tools.<integration_name>.<action_name>
```

For example, the [Crowdstrike list alerts](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates/detect/list_alerts/crowdstrike_alerts.yml)
action is called `tools.crowdstrike.list_alerts` and the [Slack post notification](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates/notify/post_notification/slack.yml)
action is called `tools.slack.post_notification`.

## Unified Ontology for Response Actions

<Tip>
  All template schemas can be found in the Tracecat GitHub repository under [`registry/tracecat_registry/schemas`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/schemas).

  Can't find the schema you're looking for?
  Check out the [contributing](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to learn how to suggest a new template schema.
