## Before you begin

Check out the [custom integrations](/tutorials/custom-integrations) tutorial to learn how to configure and sync custom integrations from a private Git repository into Tracecat.

## What is Tracecat Registry?

**Tracecat Registry** is a collection of community-driven integrations and response actions in both YAML and Python.
The majority of integrations are written in YAML as **Action Templates**, which are reusable building blocks for response automation.

Tracecat also provides built-in **OAuth integrations** for secure connections to third-party services with automatic credential management and token refresh.

All integrations can be found under the `tools` namespace with the following naming convention in lower snake case:

```
tools.<integration_name>.<action_name>
```

For example, the [Crowdstrike list alerts](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/packages/tracecat-registry/tracecat_registry/templates/detect/list_alerts/crowdstrike_alerts.yml)
action is called `tools.crowdstrike.list_alerts` and the [Slack post notification](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/packages/tracecat-registry/tracecat_registry/templates/notify/post_notification/slack.yml)
action is called `tools.slack.post_notification`.
