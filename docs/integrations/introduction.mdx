<Tip>
Can't find the integration you're looking for?
Check out the docs on custom integrations AKA [user-defined functions](/concepts/user-defined-functions).

If you believe the integration will benefit other Tracecat users,
please consider opening a pull request in the open source repo!
</Tip>

Tracecat comes with pre-built integrations to tools such as Crowdstrike, Microsoft Defender, VirusTotal, Slack and more.
