<Tip>
  We recommend installing [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which is a fast Python package and project manager, before starting this tutorial.

## Prerequisites

- A local Tracecat Docker Compose [deployment](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose)
- Python 3.12
- A python package manager (e.g. [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- (Recommended) A new [isolated Python environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/)

## Linting

<Note>
  You can safely skip this section if you do not need automatic linting and formatting.
  This setup, however, is required for contributors.
</Note>

Tracecat uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) and [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting and formatting code.
The easiest way to set up both ruff and pre-commit is to `cd` into the `custom-integrations-starter-kit` directory, add the following `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

<Accordion title="pre-commit-config.yaml" icon="code">
  ```yaml
  # See https://pre-commit.com for more information
  # See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
  default_language_version:
    python: python3.12
  default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, commit-msg]

  repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v4.6.0
      hooks:
        - id: check-added-large-files
          args:
            - --maxkb=3000
        - id: check-toml
        - id: check-yaml
          args:
            - --unsafe
        - id: end-of-file-fixer
        - id: trailing-whitespace

    - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
      rev: v0.9.1
      hooks:
        - id: ruff
          args:
            - --fix
            - --show-fixes # Show what files were fixed
            - --verbose
        - id: ruff-format
          verbose: true
  ```
</Accordion>

Then run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pre-commit  # Or `uv pip install pre-commit`
pre-commit install  # Or `uv run pre-commit install`
```

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you commit code to your local repository.
Linting helps keep code consistent according to best practices.

## Integrations Starter Kit

The recommended way to start developing custom integrations is to use the [integrations starter kit](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/custom-integrations-starter-kit).

<Steps>
  <CreateNewRepoStep />
  <Step title="Install package and tracecat_registry">
    The starter kit is a Python package with a `pyproject.toml` file.
    To install it, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd custom-integrations-starter-kit
    pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Or `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
    ```

    This `-e` flag installs the package in editable mode, which allows you to make changes to the package and have them reflected immediately.
    The `.[dev]` flag installs core and dev dependencies, which includes the `tracecat` and `tracecat_registry[cli]` Python packages.

    Find out more about the `tracecat_registry` package below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup development environment">
    The final step is to link the local registry to your local Tracecat instance.
    Step-by-step instructions are available in the [development environment](#development-environment) section below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tracecat Registry

<Note>
  `tracecat_registry` requires `tracecat` to be installed.
</Note>

Installing `tracecat_registry` will give you access to the `tc` CLI, which is used to validate your templates before syncing and running them in Tracecat.
It also includes the `tracecat_registry` package, which contains necessary imports for building Tracecat Python UDFs.

### Validation CLI

<Tip>
  We **highly recommend** using this CLI to validate your templates before syncing and running them in Tracecat.

  This will save you a lot of time debugging syntax issues.
</Tip>

To check if your templates are valid, run the following command:

```bash
tc validate template <path-to-templates>  # Or `uv run tc validate template <path-to-templates>`
```

![Registry CLI](/img/integrations/registry-cli.png)

### Local testing

`registry.register`, `Annotated`, `Doc`, and `RegistrySecret` are used to convert your Python function arguments into Tracecat action inputs.

They **do not affect** the function's behavior in Python.
You can continue using the function as normal in your scripts and tests.

## Development Environment

<Note>
  This tutorial assumes you have a local Tracecat Docker Compose [deployment](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose).
</Note>

<Warning>
  This is for local development only.

  For production, please sync your custom integrations into Tracecat from a secure remote repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab).
  Check out the [custom integrations tutorial](/tutorials/custom-integrations) for more information.
</Warning>

You can point Tracecat to your local registry by setting the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
TRACECAT__LOCAL_REPOSITORY_ENABLED=true
TRACECAT__LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH=<path-to-local-registry>
# E.g. TRACECAT__LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH=~/repos/org/custom-integrations-starter-kit
```

Don't forget to restart Tracecat:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Action templates and Python UDFs will be hot loaded into your Tracecat instance.
Changes in your local registry are automatically reflected in Tracecat.
No sync is required.
