You will need to install [`tracecat_registry`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry).
The recommended way to do this is by using the [custom-integrations-starter-kit](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/custom-integrations-starter-kit).
All you need to do is specify `dev` dependencies when installing the project.

```bash
cd custom-integrations-starter-kit
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
