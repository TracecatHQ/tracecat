title: Quickstart
description: Automate AWS GuardDuty alerting in 15 minutes
---

Tracecat can operate in **headless** (no frontend UI) and **GUI** modes.

We'll build a simple security automation that does the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive an incoming webhook request">
    We'll `curl` the webhook directly to trigger the workflow with predefined
    inputs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pull AWS GuardDuty alerts">
    Retrieve the latest GuardDuty alerts from AWS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transform results into SMAC alerts">
    Organize the alerts according to the SMAC (`Subject`, `Malice`, `Action`,
    and `Context`) framework.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish results to a Slack channel">
    Send the SMAC alerts to a Slack channel of your choice.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup

The fastest way to get started with Tracecat is to run it locally in **headless** mode.
We'll be running Tracecat without authentication for this quickstart.
You will also need to create a Slack bot.

## Step 1: Install Tracecat

See the [installation guide](/installation) for instructions on how to install and operate Tracecat headless.

### Set a few environment variables

This is done for convenience, so you can copy and paste the commands below without modification.

````bash
export TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
```

## Step 2: Create a new workflow

With Tracecat running, create a new workflow using the following `curl` command from your terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/workflows" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"My first workflow"}'
````

Take note of the workflow ID (prefiexed with `wf-`) returned. We'll refer to this as `$WORKFLOW_ID`.

<Tip>
  You may finc convenience exporting it as an environment variable so you can
  run copied command snippets directly: ```bash export
  WORKFLOW_ID=wf-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX # Replace with your actual workflow ID ```
</Tip>
<Note>
  Please replace `$WORKFLOW_ID` with the actual ID (some `wf-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)
  in the following steps if you don't export it as an environment variable.
</Note>

## Step 3: Build the workflow using YAML

Create a file called `send_aws_guardduty_alerts_to_slack.yml` and add the following contents:
Create a [Slack bot](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) and note down the bot token.

<Note>
  You'll have to create a replace `YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` with your actual Slack
  channel ID (some `CXXXXXXXXX`).
</Note>

## Step 4: Commit changes to the workflow

This step converts the YAML file into a [Workflow Definition](/workflow-definition), meaning it can now be executed by Tracecat workflow runners.

```bash
curl -X POST "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/commit" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -F "yaml_file=@/path/to/slack_notifications_for_aws_guardduty.yml"
```

## Step 5: Activate workflow and webhook

On creation, workflows and their webhooks are deactivated by default. You need to enable them before they can be triggered.

```bash
curl -X PATCH  "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/webhook" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"online"}'
curl -X PATCH  "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"online"}'
```

## Step 6: Trigger the workflow

Grab the webhook URL, then trigger the workflow by sending a POST request to the webhook URL:

````bash
# Get the webhook from

```bash
curl -X POST "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/webhook" -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token"
```

```bash
# Set the webhook URL
export TC_WEBHOOK_URL=... # Replace with 'url' from the previous command
```


curl -X POST "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/webhooks/$WORKFLOW_ID/$WEBHOOK_SECRET" \
  -H "
````
