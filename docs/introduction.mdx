[Tracecat](https://tracecat.com) is a modern, open source automation platform built for security and IT engineers.
It's an open source Tines / Splunk SOAR alternative.
Tracecat comes with a no-code / low-code UI for workflows, out-of-the-box integrations, lookup tables, and case management.
Workflows are orchestrated using [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) for scale and reliability.

## Get Started

<Tip>
  We highly recommend every user complete the [quickstart tutorial](/quickstart/tutorial).

## Tutorials

<Note>
  You can sync custom YAML integrations and Python scripts directly into Tracecat from a private Git repo.
  Learn more in the [custom integrations](/tutorials/custom-integrations) tutorial.

  This is the recommended way to use Tracecat.
  All reusable integrations should be stored and version controlled in your own GitHub / GitLab repository.
