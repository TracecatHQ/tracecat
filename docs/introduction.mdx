[Tracecat](https://tracecat.com) is the open workflow automation platform for security and IT engineers.
It's an open source Tines / Splunk SOAR alternative with response-as-code.
Tracecat is built on a simple YAML-based DSL for integrations, no-code UI for workflows, and [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) for scale and reliability.

## Why Tracecat?

We're on a mission to make security and IT automation more accessible through **response-as-code**.
What Sigma rules did for detection and Nuclei did for vulnerability scanning, Tracecat is doing for response automation.

## Get Started

<Tip>
  We highly recommend every user complete the [quickstart tutorial](/quickstart/tutorial).
  This tutorial covers all the core features of Tracecat, which will save you hours of learning time.

## Tutorials

<Note>
  One of the most powerful features of Tracecat is the ability to sync custom YAML templates and Python scripts from your private GitHub / GitLab repo.
  Learn more in the [custom integrations](/tutorials/custom-integrations) tutorial.

  This is the recommended way to use Tracecat. All custom API calls and reusable actions should eventually be stored and version controlled in your repository.
