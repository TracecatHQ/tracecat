## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Call REST APIs via the `core.http_request` action
- Trigger workflows manually via the UI
- Add secrets to your workflows
- Define if-conditions in your workflows
- Define any / all conditions in your workflows
- Run actions in a loop

## Prerequisites

- Have Tracecat [installed](/quickstart/install)
- An API key from [URLScan](https://urlscan.io/user/profile/)

## Your first workflow

<YamlNote />

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create new workflow" icon="circle-plus">
    Click the `Create new` button in the top right corner of the workflows page.
    ![Create workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/create-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rename workflow" icon="pencil">
    Click on the empty workflow canvas to open the workflow settings panel.
    You can change the name and description of the workflow here.
    ![Rename workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/rename-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View available actions" icon="square-plus">
    To add a new node to the workflow, either drag out the actions dropdown menu from the trigger node or right click on the workflow canvas.
    ![View available actions](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-available-actions.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add HTTP request action" icon="globe">
    Search for and select the `core.http_request` action.
    ![Add HTTP action](/img/quickstart/tutorial/add-http-action.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Call an external weather API" icon="cloud-sun">
    Click on the `core.http_request` node and fill in the inputs.
    Tracecat uses YAML to define action inputs.
    Press the `cmd+s` or `ctrl+s` keys to save your inputs.

    ```yaml
    url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
    method: GET
    params:
      latitude: 37.773972
      longitude: -122.431297
      current: temperature_2m,precipitation_probability
    ```

    ![Fill in HTTP request inputs](/img/quickstart/tutorial/http-inputs.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save workflow" icon="floppy-disk">
    Before you can run your workflow, you need to save it.
    You must explicitly save your workflow for changes to take effect in workflow runs.

    ![Save workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/save-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run workflow via UI" icon="play">
    Click the `Run` button to execute your workflow.

    You can ignore the sample webhook payload.
    In a future [tutorial](/docs/workflows/triggers), we will learn how to pass custom payloads into workflows manually via UI or webhook.

    ![Run workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/run-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View most recent run" icon="person-running">
    You can view the status of your most recent run in the left side panel.
    Select actions row by row to view their inputs and outputs.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Events">
        ![View events](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-events.png)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Action input">
        ![View action input](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-action-input.png)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Action result">
        ![View action result](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-action-result.png)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View supported action inputs" icon="list">
    You can view the required and optional inputs for an action under the `Input Schema` section.
    ![View input schema](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-input-schema.png)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## If-conditions

Every action can be turned into a conditional action.
Under the `If condition / Loops` tab, you can specify a condition that determines whether the action should be executed.

For example, to run the `Get result` action only if the URL submission was successful, go to the `If condition / Loops` tab and specify the following in the `Run if` input:

```yaml
${{ ACTIONS.scan_url.result.data.message == "Submission successful" }}
```

![Run if](/img/quickstart/tutorial/run-if.png)

## Any / All Conditions

Consider the case where you have multiple upstream actions that connect to one downstream joining node.
You can control whether the joining node should run if `all` or `any` of the upstream actions succeed or fail.

Configure this by going to the `If condition / Loops` tab of the joining node and setting the `join_strategy` option to `all` or `any`.

![Join strategy](/img/quickstart/tutorial/join-strategy.png)

## Loops

Every action can be turned into a looped action.
Under the `If condition / Loops` tab, you can specify loop expressions to iterate over a list of items and run the action for each item.

<Tip>
  You can loop over any list of items in your workflow context.
  For example, it can be a list of file hashes in a previous action `ACTIONS.some_intel_feed.result.data.malware_samples` or a list of items received via webhook in `TRIGGER`.
</Tip>

**Example**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the loop">
    Define a loop expression using the `${{ for var.some_variable_name in some_list }}` syntax.
    The variable name can be anything you want, but we recommend using a name that makes sense for the items in the list.

    In this example, we iterate through a list of numbers send via webhook in `TRIGGER`.

    ```yaml
    ${{ for var.number in TRIGGER.numbers }}
    ```

    ![Define loop expression](/img/quickstart/tutorial/loop-expression.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the loop variable">
    Go back to the action's `Inputs` tab.
    You can now use the loop variable in the action's inputs using the `${{ var.some_variable_name }}` syntax.
    During the workflow run, each `var.some_variable_name` in the loop expression is replaced with the current item in the list.

    In this example, we use the loop variable in `core.transform.reshape` action to iterate through a list of numbers and add one to each number.

    ```yaml
    value: ${{ var.number + 1 }}
    ```

    ![Add one to variable](/img/quickstart/tutorial/add-one-to-variable.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run workflow">
    Run the workflow via UI with the payload `{"numbers": [1, 2, 3]}` to see the loop in action.

    The `core.transform.reshape` action will be executed three times with `var.number` being `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively and the output will be `[2, 3, 4]`.
