## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Call REST APIs via the `core.http_request` action
- Trigger workflows manually via the UI
- Add secrets to your workflows

## Prerequisites

- Have Tracecat [installed](/quickstart/install)
- An API key from [URLScan](https://urlscan.io/user/profile/)

## Your first workflow

<YamlNote />

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create new workflow" icon="circle-plus">
    Click the `Create new` button in the top right corner of the workflows page.
    ![Create workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/create-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rename workflow" icon="pencil">
    Click on the empty workflow canvas to open the workflow settings panel.
    You can change the name and description of the workflow here.
    ![Rename workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/rename-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View available actions" icon="square-plus">
    To add a new node to the workflow, either drag out the actions dropdown menu from the trigger node or right click on the workflow canvas.
    ![View available actions](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-available-actions.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add HTTP request action" icon="globe">
    Search for and select the `core.http_request` action.
    ![Add HTTP action](/img/quickstart/tutorial/add-http-action.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Call an external weather API" icon="cloud-sun">
    Click on the `core.http_request` node and fill in the inputs.
    Tracecat uses YAML to define action inputs.
    Press the `cmd+s` or `ctrl+s` keys to save your inputs.

    ```yaml
    url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
    method: GET
    params:
      latitude: 37.773972
      longitude: -122.431297
      current: temperature_2m,precipitation_probability
    ```

    ![Fill in HTTP request inputs](/img/quickstart/tutorial/http-inputs.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save workflow" icon="floppy-disk">
    Before you can run your workflow, you need to save it.
    You must explicitly save your workflow for changes to take effect in workflow runs.

    ![Save workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/save-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run workflow via UI" icon="play">
    Click the `Run` button to execute your workflow.

    You can ignore the sample webhook payload.
    In a future [tutorial](/tutorials/workflow-triggers), we will learn how to pass custom payloads into workflows manually via UI or webhook.

    ![Run workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/run-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View most recent run" icon="person-running">
    You can view the status of your most recent run in the left side panel.
    Select actions row by row to view their inputs and outputs.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Events">
        ![View events](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-events.png)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Action input">
        ![View action input](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-action-input.png)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Action result">
        ![View action result](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-action-result.png)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View supported action inputs" icon="list">
    You can view the required and optional inputs for an action under the `Input schema` section.
    ![View input schema](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-input-schema.png)
  </Accordion>

## Actions and integrations

Actions are the building blocks of Tracecat workflows.
Tracecat has two main types of actions:

- `core` actions for core functionality (e.g. HTTP request, AI action, and data transforms).
- `tools` actions for integrations to 3rd-party services.

Find out more in Tracecat's [core actions](/integrations/core) and [tools](/integrations/tools) docs.

<JsonpathNote />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for integrations" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Search for pre-built integrations in the actions dropdown menu.
    Do this by right clicking on the workflow canvas or dragging it out from an existing node.

    ![View available actions](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-available-actions.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in inputs" icon="keyboard">
    Fill in the required and optional inputs in the `Inputs` section.

    ![Action inputs](/img/quickstart/tutorial/action-inputs.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View schema and metadata" icon="file-lines">
    Expand the `Input schema` section to view all supported inputs and required secrets.

    ![Action input schema](/img/quickstart/tutorial/action-input-schema.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View template" icon="code">
    Click on the `View template` tab to view the YAML code for **Action Template** integrations.
    You can also view the integration's **action type**, **origin**, and **documentation URL** at the top of the action's settings panel.
