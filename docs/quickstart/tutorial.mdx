## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Call REST APIs via the `core.http_request` action
- Trigger workflows manually via the UI
- Add secrets to your workflows
- Define if-conditions in your workflows
- Define any / all conditions in your workflows
- Run actions in a loop

## Prerequisites

- Have Tracecat [installed](/quickstart/install)
- An API key from [URLScan](https://urlscan.io/user/profile/)

## Your first workflow

<Note>
  Tracecat uses YAML to define inputs and configurations for actions and workflows.
  YAML is a human-readable configuration language that is easy to write and read.
  It is also more concise than JSON and more customizable than HTML forms.

  If you're new to YAML, you can learn more [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html).
  YAML is also widely used in DevOps tools like Ansible, GitHub Actions, and Docker Compose.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rename workflow" icon="pencil">
    Click on the empty workflow canvas to open the workflow settings panel.
    You can change the name and description of the workflow here.

  <Accordion title="View available actions" icon="square-plus">
    To add a new node to the workflow, either drag out the actions dropdown menu from the trigger node or right click on the workflow canvas.
    ![View available actions](/img/quickstart/tutorial/view-available-actions.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add HTTP request action" icon="globe">
    Search for and select the `core.http_request` action.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Call an external weather API" icon="cloud-sun">
    Click on the `core.http_request` node and fill in the inputs.
    Tracecat uses YAML to define action inputs.
    Press the `cmd+s` or `ctrl+s` keys to save your inputs.

    ```yaml
    url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
    method: GET
    params:
      latitude: 37.773972
      longitude: -122.431297
      current: temperature_2m,precipitation_probability
    ```

    ![Fill in HTTP request inputs](/img/quickstart/tutorial/http-inputs.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save workflow" icon="floppy-disk">
    Before you can run your workflow, you need to save it.
    You must explicitly save your workflow for changes to take effect in workflow runs.

    ![Save workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/save-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run workflow via UI" icon="play">
    Click the `Run` button to execute your workflow.

    You can ignore the sample webhook payload.
    In a future [tutorial](/docs/workflows/triggers), we will learn how to pass custom payloads into workflows manually via UI or webhook.

    ![Run workflow](/img/quickstart/tutorial/run-workflow.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View most recent run" icon="person-running">
    You can view the status of your most recent run in the left side panel.
    Select actions row by row to view their inputs and outputs.

      <Tab title="Events">

  <Accordion title="View supported action inputs" icon="list">
    You can view the required and optional inputs for an action under the `Input Schema` section.

## Action Inputs

## If-conditions

Every action can be turned into a conditional action.
Under the `If condition / Loops` tab, you can specify a condition that determines whether the action should be executed.

For example, to run the `Get result` action only if the URL submission was successful, go to the `If condition / Loops` tab and specify the following in the `Run if` input:

```yaml
${{ ACTIONS.scan_url.result.data.message == "Submission successful" }}
```

![Run if](/img/quickstart/tutorial/run-if.png)

## Any / All Conditions

## Loops

Every action can be turned into a looped action.
Under the `If condition / Loops` tab, you can specify loop expressions to iterate over a list of items and run the action for each item.

<Tip>
  You can loop over any list of items in your workflow context.
  For example, it can be a list of file hashes in a previous action `ACTIONS.some_intel_feed.result.data.malware_samples` or a list of items received via webhook in `TRIGGER`.
</Tip>

**Example**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the loop">
    Define a loop expression using the `${{ for var.some_variable_name in some_list }}` syntax.
    The variable name can be anything you want, but we recommend using a name that makes sense for the items in the list.

    In this example, we iterate through a list of numbers send via webhook in `TRIGGER`.

    ```yaml
    ${{ for var.number in TRIGGER.numbers }}
    ```

    ![Define loop expression](/img/quickstart/tutorial/loop-expression.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the loop variable">
    Go back to the action's `Inputs` tab.
    You can now use the loop variable in the action's inputs using the `${{ var.some_variable_name }}` syntax.
    During the workflow run, each `var.some_variable_name` in the loop expression is replaced with the current item in the list.

    In this example, we use the loop variable in `core.transform.reshape` action to iterate through a list of numbers and add one to each number.

    ```yaml
    value: ${{ var.number + 1 }}
    ```

    ![Add one to variable](/img/quickstart/tutorial/add-one-to-variable.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run workflow">
    Run the workflow via UI with the payload `{"numbers": [1, 2, 3]}` to see the loop in action.

    The `core.transform.reshape` action will be executed three times with `var.number` being `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively and the output will be `[2, 3, 4]`.
