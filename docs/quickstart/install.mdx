Tracecat supports three deployment options:

- Docker Compose
- AWS Fargate via Terraform
- Kubernetes via Helm (coming soon)

### Docker Compose

<DeploymentNote />

Deploy a local Tracecat stack using Docker Compose. View step-by-step instructions [here](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose).

```bash
# Download Tracecat
git clone https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat.git

# Generate .env file
./env.sh

# Run Tracecat
docker compose up -d
```

<PublicUrlNote />

Check out the generated `.env` file to better understand Tracecat's configurations.
You can also view the template `.env.example` file [here](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/0.28.0/.env.example).

### AWS Fargate

**For advanced users:** deploy a production-ready Tracecat stack on AWS Fargate using Terraform. View step-by-step instructions [here](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/aws-ecs).

```bash
# Download Terraform files
git clone https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
cd tracecat/deployments/aws

# Create and add encryption keys to AWS Secrets Manager
./scripts/create-aws-secrets.sh

# Run Terraform to deploy Tracecat
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Kubernetes

Coming soon.
