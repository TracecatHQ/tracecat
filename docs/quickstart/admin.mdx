<Note>
  This tutorial assumes you have set `TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES=basic` in your `.env`
  file. For production deployments, we highly recommend using [SAML
  SSO](/self-hosting/authentication/saml-sso) or [Google
  OAuth](/self-hosting/authentication/google-oauth).
</Note>

## User Roles

Tracecat has a two-level permission system:

### Organization Roles

| Role  | Permissions                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin | Has access to all API endpoints and all workspaces, can administer organization-level (platform) settings and management APIs (`/organization`) |
| Basic | Can only access workspaces they've been invited to and non-management APIs                                                                      |

### Workspace Roles

| Role   | Permissions                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Admin  | Can manage workspace membership, create/update/delete secrets, and all other workspace functions |
| Editor | Non-management workspace functions                                                               |

## Organization owner

The first user who logs into Tracecat is automatically assigned both `superuser` and an organization admin role. Currently,
the `superuser` role does not have any additional permissions beyond the organization admin role.

## Security

Define the `TRACECAT__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable to restrict the email domains that can log into Tracecat.
For example, to restrict access to email addresses from `tracecat.com` and `example.com`, set the following:

```bash
TRACECAT__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=tracecat.com,example.com
```

## Login as admin

  <Step title="Access Tracecat">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Invite new users

To add new users to Tracecat, the user must first sign-up to Tracecat.
They will be redirected to the following page:

![new-user](/img/quickstart/admin/new-user.png)

To invite the new user to a workspace, first log into Tracecat as an organization or workspace admin, then follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Workspace members">
    Select the workspace you want to invite the user to, then under the settings
    menu, click `Manage members`. ![Workspace member
    settings](/img/quickstart/admin/manage-members.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add workspace member">
    Click the `Add member` button, then enter the email address of the new user
    that signed up. You can assign them either Workspace `Admin` or `Editor`
    role. ![Add workspace member](/img/quickstart/admin/add-member.png) The new
    user will show up as: ![Members
    list](/img/quickstart/admin/members-list.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login as new user">
    The new user can now log into Tracecat using the email address and password
    they used to sign up. They will be redirected to the workspace they were
    invited to. ![New basic user](/img/quickstart/admin/new-basic-user.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organization Admin Settings

Organization admins have the ability to:

- View all users and sessions.
- View all workspaces and settings.
- Remove any non-admin user from any workspace.
- Revoke active sessions for any user.
- Manage organization-level settings.

![Remove user](/img/quickstart/admin/remove-user.png)

![Revoke session](/img/quickstart/admin/revoke-session.png)

### Automatic workspace creation

By default, new users need to be invited to a workspace after registration.
You can configure Tracecat to automatically create a workspace for new users when they sign up by enabling `Create workspace on signup` in the application settings.

![create-workspace-on-signup](/img/quickstart//admin/create-workspace-on-signup.png)

When enabled, each new user will join as a workspace administrator.
