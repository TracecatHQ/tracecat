## Admin superuser

The admin superuser role is assigned to the first user who logs into Tracecat. This user owns the organization and has admin rights to every workspace in the Tracecat deployment.

You can configure which email domains are allowed to log into Tracecat via the `TRACECAT__AUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable.

## Log in

<Note>
This tutorial assumes you have set `TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES=basic` in your `.env` file.
For production deployments, we highly recommend using [SAML SSO](/self-hosting/authentication/saml) or [Google OAuth](/self-hosting/authentication/google).
