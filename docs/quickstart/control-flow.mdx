## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Define if-conditions in your workflows
- Define any / all conditions in your workflows
- Run actions in a loop


## If-conditions

<Tip>
  View all supported binary operators (e.g. `==`, `>`,`in`) in the [functions cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/functions).
</Tip>

Every action can be turned into a conditional action.
Under the `If condition / Loops` tab, you can specify a condition that determines whether the action should be executed.

For example, to run the `Get result` action only if the URL submission was successful, go to the `If condition / Loops` tab and specify the following in the `Run if` input:

```php
${{ ACTIONS.scan_url.result.data.message == "Submission successful" }}
```

**Examples**

<Note>
  Conditional expressions are one of the most powerful features in Tracecat.
  Combine binary operators and in-line functions to express complex conditions with ease.
</Note>

Here are examples of commonly used conditional expressions.

<CodeGroup>
  ```php Boolean Checks
  # Check if condition is True
  ${{ bool(ACTIONS.is_enabled.result) }}

  # Check if condition is False
  ${{ bool(ACTIONS.is_locked.result) }}

  # Note: If the condition is already truthy
  # or falsy there's no need to use bool()
  ${{ ACTIONS.is_enabled.result }}
  ```

  ```php Basic Comparison
  # Equal to
  ${{ ACTIONS.user_role.result == "admin" }}

  # Not equal to
  ${{ ACTIONS.environment.result != "production" }}

  # Greater than
  ${{ ACTIONS.failed_attempts.result > 5 }}

  # Less than
  ${{ ACTIONS.response_time.result < 1000 }}

  # Greater than or equal to
  ${{ ACTIONS.cpu_usage.result >= 90 }}

  # Less than or equal to
  ${{ ACTIONS.memory_usage.result <= 80 }}
  ```

  ```php List Operations
  # Check if value is in list
  ${{ ACTIONS.ip_address.result in ['192.168.1.1', '10.0.0.1'] }}

  # Check if value is not in list
  ${{ ACTIONS.status.result not in ['error', 'failed', 'timeout'] }}

  # Check if value is in dynamic list
  ${{ ACTIONS.alert.severity in ACTIONS.get_critical_levels.result }}
  ```

  ```php Identity Checks
  # Check if value is None/null
  ${{ ACTIONS.optional_field.result == None }}

  # Check if value is not None/null
  ${{ ACTIONS.required_field.result != None }}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You can also combine multiple conditions using the `&&` and `||` operators:

```php Combined Conditions
# Check if user is admin and CPU usage is high
${{ ACTIONS.user_role.result == "admin" && ACTIONS.cpu_usage.result >= 90 }}

# Check if either memory or CPU usage is critical
${{ ACTIONS.memory_usage.result >= 95 || ACTIONS.cpu_usage.result >= 95 }}
```

## Any / All Conditions

Consider the case where you have multiple upstream actions that connect to one downstream joining node.
You can control whether the joining node should run if `all` or `any` of the upstream actions succeed or fail.

Configure this by going to the `If condition / Loops` tab of the joining node and setting the `join_strategy` option to `all` or `any`.

## Loops

Every action can be turned into a looped action.
Under the `If condition / Loops` tab, you can specify loop expressions to iterate over a list of items and run the action for each item.

<Tip>
  You can loop over any list of items in your workflow context.
  For example, it can be a list of file hashes in a previous action `ACTIONS.some_intel_feed.result.data.malware_samples` or a list of items received via webhook in `TRIGGER`.
</Tip>

**Example**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the loop">
    Define a loop expression using the `${{ for var.some_variable_name in some_list }}` syntax.
    The variable name can be anything you want, but we recommend using a name that makes sense for the items in the list.

    In this example, we iterate through a list of numbers send via webhook in `TRIGGER`.

    ```php
    ${{ for var.number in TRIGGER.numbers }}
    ```

    ![Define loop expression](/img/quickstart/tutorial/loop-expression.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the loop variable">
    Go back to the action's `Inputs` tab.
    You can now use the loop variable in the action's inputs using the `${{ var.some_variable_name }}` syntax.
    During the workflow run, each `var.some_variable_name` in the loop expression is replaced with the current item in the list.

    In this example, we use the loop variable in `core.transform.reshape` action to iterate through a list of numbers and add one to each number.

    ```php
    value: ${{ var.number + 1 }}
    ```

    ![Add one to variable](/img/quickstart/tutorial/add-one-to-variable.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run workflow">
    Run the workflow via UI with the payload `{"numbers": [1, 2, 3]}` to see the loop in action.

    The `core.transform.reshape` action will be executed three times with `var.number` being `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively and the output will be `[2, 3, 4]`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Do-while loops (`core.loop.start` + `core.loop.end`)

Tracecat also supports explicit do-while control flow with `core.loop.start` and
`core.loop.end`.

- `core.loop.start` opens the loop region and seeds the current iteration.
- `core.loop.end` closes the loop region and decides whether to continue.

**Shape**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  LoopStart([loop_start])
  LoopBody["loop body actions"]
  LoopEnd([loop_end])
  After([after])

  LoopStart --> LoopBody
  LoopBody --> LoopEnd
  LoopEnd -->|continue = true| LoopStart
  LoopEnd -->|continue = false| After
```

**Iteration value**

- Iteration is 0-based.
- Access it via `${{ ACTIONS.<loop_start_ref>.result.iteration }}`.

**Condition behavior**

- `core.loop.end` evaluates `condition` only when reached in normal execution.
- If `core.loop.end` is reached in skip propagation mode, condition is not
  evaluated and the loop exits (`continue = false`).


**Condition reference scope**

- `core.loop.end.condition` can only reference actions in the loop scope that
  the `core.loop.end` closes.
- Referencing sibling or nested per-item scatter actions is invalid.
- If condition logic depends on scatter work inside the loop, reference the
  synchronized `gather` output (in loop scope), not the per-item action.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "Valid"
    ValidStart([loop_start])
    ValidScatter["scatter"]
    ValidPerItem["per_item"]
    ValidGather["gather"]
    ValidEnd([loop_end])

    ValidStart --> ValidScatter --> ValidPerItem --> ValidGather --> ValidEnd
    ValidEnd -->|"loop_end.condition uses"| ValidCondition1["ACTIONS.gather.result"]
  end

  subgraph "Invalid"
    InvalidStart([loop_start])
    InvalidScatter["scatter"]
    InvalidPerItem["per_item"]
    InvalidGather["gather"]
    InvalidEnd([loop_end])

    InvalidStart --> InvalidScatter --> InvalidPerItem --> InvalidGather --> InvalidEnd
    InvalidEnd -->|"loop_end.condition uses"| InvalidCondition["ACTIONS.per_item.result"]
  end
```

**Skip propagation edge cases**

1. Skip reaches `loop_start` from outside the loop region:
   - The loop unit (`loop_start -> ... -> loop_end`) is treated as skipped.
   - Skip propagation continues downstream from `loop_end`.
2. Skip starts inside the loop region, but another dependency still reaches
   `loop_end`:
   - `loop_end` executes normally.
   - `condition` is evaluated as usual.
3. Skip starts inside the loop region and all paths into `loop_end` are skipped:
   - `loop_end` acts as a skip boundary (break-like behavior).
   - Condition is not evaluated.
   - Execution continues to downstream nodes after `loop_end`.

**Other loop semantics**

- Results in the loop body are overwritten when an action runs again.
- If an action is skipped in an iteration, its previous result is retained.
- `max_iterations` protects against unbounded loops and fails the run when the
  limit is exceeded (platform hard cap: `2048`).
