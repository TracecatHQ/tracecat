<Tip>
  All core actions are open source and available in [Tracecat's GitHub repository](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/base/core).
</Tip>

<Note>
  The docs below only cover the `core` namespace.
  For information on `core.transform` and `core.workflow`, check out the tutorials on [Data Transforms](/quickstart/data-transforms) and [Child Workflows](/quickstart/child-workflows).
</Note>

Core actions are the building blocks of Tracecat workflows and action templates.
All core actions are under the `core` namespace.
They are distinct from pre-built integrations in the `tools` namespace, which are pre-configured for specific 3rd-party tools.

There are three sub-namespaces under `core`:

- `core`
- `core.transform`
- `core.workflow`

`core` actions are the most commonly used actions in Tracecat.
They include:

| Name | Display Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core.http_request` | `HTTP Request` | Make a HTTP request. |
| `core.http_poll` | `HTTP Polling` | Poll a REST API until a condition is met. |
| `core.ai_action` | `AI Action` | Prompt a LLM (e.g. OpenAI, self-hosted) to take an action. |

## HTTP Request

The `core.http_request` action supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests.

- To make a `GET` request with query parameters, specify the `params` field.
- To make a `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` request with:
  - JSON encoded body, specify the `payload` field.
  - Form-encoded data, specify the `form_data` field.
- To make a request with a custom HTTP headers, specify the `headers` field.

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml GET
  url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
  method: GET
  params:
    latitude: 37.773972
    longitude: -122.431297
    current: temperature_2m,precipitation_probability
  ```

  ```yaml POST
  url: https://api.urlscan.io/v1/scan
  method: POST
  headers:
    API-Key: ${{ SECRETS.urlscan.URLSCAN_API_KEY }}
    Content-Type: application/json
  payload:
    url: https://example.com
    visibility: private
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Polling HTTP Request

Tracecat makes it easy to poll APIs with long-running operations using the `core.http_poll` action.
To configure the `core.http_poll` action, you'll need to specify one of the following inputs:

- `poll_retry_codes`: List of status codes on which the action will retry.
- `poll_condition`: A Python lambda function string that determines whether to retry.

If the operation doesn't poll on a status code, `poll_condition` is required.
It is a Python lambda function string that determines whether to retry based on:
- `headers`: The HTTP headers of the response.
- `data`: The JSON decoded response body.

For example, to poll on a response body containing `"status"` until it equals `"complete"`, you can specify the following:

```yaml
poll_condition: "lambda x: x['data']['status'] == 'complete'"
```

You can further configure the polling behavior via the optional inputs:

- `poll_interval`: Seconds between polling attempts. Defaults to exponential wait.
- `poll_max_attempts`: Maximum number of polling attempts. Defaults to 10.

<Accordion title="Example: URLScan" icon="globe">
  URLScan uses a two-step process to get a threat intelligence report on a URL:

  1. Call the `/scan` endpoint to submit the URL for scanning.
  2. Poll the `/result` endpoint repeatedly until the status code changes from `404` to `200`.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create URLScan secret">
      Add URLScan API key to Tracecat's built-in secrets manager.

      <SecretsExample />

    </Step>
    <Step title="Call /scan endpoint">
      Add the `core.http_request` action to your workflow.
      Rename it to `Submit URL` and configure it with the following inputs:

      ```yaml
      url: https://urlscan.io/api/v1/scan/
      method: POST
      headers:
        API-key: ${{ SECRETS.urlscan.URLSCAN_API_KEY }}
      payload:
        url: https://crowdstrikebluescreen.com
        visibility: private
      ```

      ![Scan URL](/img/quickstart/core-actions/scan-url.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Poll /result endpoint">
      Add the `core.http_poll` action to your workflow.
      Rename it to `Get result` and configure it with the following inputs:

      ```yaml
      url: https://urlscan.io/api/v1/result/${{ ACTIONS.scan_url.result.data.uuid }}
      method: GET
      poll_retry_codes: [404]
      headers:
        API-key: ${{ SECRETS.urlscan.URLSCAN_API_KEY }}
      ```

      ![Get URLScan result](/img/quickstart/core-actions/get-urlscan-result.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run workflow">
      Run the workflow to submit the URL for scanning and get the threat intelligence report.
      Under the hood, `Get result` calls the `/result` endpoint repeatedly until the status code is `200`.
