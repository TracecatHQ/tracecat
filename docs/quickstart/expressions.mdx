Expressions is how you reference and manipulate data inline in action inputs, run-if conditions, and loop expressions.
Tracecat supports the following expression contexts:

| Prefix    | Expression syntax                          | Description                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ACTIONS` | `ACTIONS.<action_slug>.result.<jsonpath>`  | Reference the result of an action         |
| `TRIGGER` | `TRIGGER.<jsonpath>`                       | Reference data passed via webhook or UI   |
| `SECRETS` | `SECRETS.<name>.<key>`                     | Reference a secret                        |
| `FN`      | `FN.<fn_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...)`        | Call an inline function                   |

To use an expression, you must use the `${{ <context>.<expression> }}` syntax:

```yaml
${{ <context>.<expression> }}
```

Expressions are evaluated into values at the start of each action run.

## `ACTIONS` context

<Info>
  Tracecat uses [JSONPath](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng?tab=readme-ov-file#jsonpath-syntax) and dot notation to select outputs from previous actions.

  For example, `ACTIONS.my_action.result.data.items` selects the `items` field from a nested JSON object returned by the `my_action` action.
</Info>

You can reference outputs from a previous action in the same workflow using the `ACTIONS` context.
Actions are referenced by a sluggified version of their name.

<Accordion icon="book-open" title="Example">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Rename action">
      For example, let's assume you renamed the `core.http_request` action in [Your first workflow](#your-first-workflow) from `HTTP Request` to `Get weather`.
      You can rename the action under the `General` section in the action inputs panel.

      ![Rename action](/img/quickstart/expressions/rename-action.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Reference action output">
      You can then reference the `Get weather` action's output in the next action by using the `ACTIONS.get_weather.result` expression.
      For example, you can use the `core.transform.reshape` action as a pass-through action to extract and organize the weather data.

      ```yaml
      value:
        temp: ${{ ACTIONS.get_weather.result.data.current.temperature_2m }}
        rain: ${{ ACTIONS.get_weather.result.data.current.precipitation_probability }}
      ```

      ![Reference action result](/img/quickstart/expressions/reference-action-result.png)

      You can then reference the `temp` and `rain` outputs in downstream actions in the workflow using:

      ```yaml
      ${{ ACTIONS.reshape.result.temp }}
      ${{ ACTIONS.reshape.result.rain }}
      ```
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

## `TRIGGER` context

<Info>
  Check out the [workflow triggers](/tutorials/workflow-triggers.mdx) tutorial for a detailed guide setting up webhooks for workflows.
</Info>

Workflows can be triggered via webhook, manual UI trigger, or the `Execute Child Workflow` action.
Use the `TRIGGER` context to reference the data from the trigger as a JSON object.


<Accordion title="Manual trigger example" icon="play">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Send webhook">
      For example, if you send a `POST` request to the workflow's webhook URL with the following payload:

      ```json
      {"lat": 40, "long": 70}
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Reference webhook payload">
      You can reference the `lat` and `long` values in an action's inputs using the `TRIGGER` context.

      ```yaml
      url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
      method: GET
      params:
        latitude: ${{ TRIGGER.lat }}
        longitude: ${{ TRIGGER.long }}
            current: temperature_2m,precipitation_probability
      ```

      ![Reference webhook payload](/img/quickstart/expressions/reference-webhook-payload.png)
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook example" icon="globe">
  Given a workflow with a live webhook, the following curl command will send the JSON payload `{"data": {"name": "John", "age": 30}}` and trigger the workflow:

  ```bash
  export WEBHOOK_URL=https://tracecat.com/api/webhooks/<webhook_id>/<secret>
  curl -X POST $WEBHOOK_URL \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"data": {"name": "John", "age": 30}}'
  ```

  The following expression will return the string `John`:

  ```php
  ${{ TRIGGER.data.name }}
  ```
</Accordion>

## `SECRETS` context

Tracecat comes with a built-in secrets manager.
This allows you to store and retrieve sensitive data **scoped to a workspace** without exposing the value in plaintext.
Secrets are encrypted at rest and stored in the database.

Secrets stored in the secrets manager can be accessed using the `SECRETS` prefix:

```php
${{ SECRETS.<name>.<key> }}
```

Tracecat will automatically replace the expression with the secret value at runtime.
Retrieved secrets are deleted from memory after the workflow run completes.

## `FN` context

<Tip>
  Check out the full list of supported functions in the [functions](/cheatsheets/functions) cheatsheet.
</Tip>

Tracecat supports inline functions in the `FN` context.
For example, you can use the `FN.deserialize_json` function to decode a JSON string into a JSON object.

```yaml
${{ FN.deserialize_json(ACTIONS.get_weather.result.data) }}
```
