## `ACTIONS.` namespace

<Info>
  Tracecat uses [JSONPath](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng?tab=readme-ov-file#jsonpath-syntax) and dot notation to select outputs from previous actions.
</Info>

You can reference outputs from a previous action in the same workflow using the `ACTIONS.` namespace.
Actions are referenced by a sluggified version of their name.

<Accordion title="Example">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Rename action">
      For example, let's assume you renamed the `core.http_request` action in [Your first workflow](#your-first-workflow) from `HTTP Request` to `Get weather`.
      You can rename the action under the `General` section in the action inputs panel.

      ![Rename action](/img/quickstart/expressions/rename-action.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Reference action output">
      You can then reference the `Get weather` action's output in the next action by using the `ACTIONS.get_weather.result` namespace.
      For example, you can use the `core.transform.reshape` action as a pass-through action to extract and organize the weather data.

      ```yaml
      value:
        temp: ${{ ACTIONS.get_weather.result.data.current.temperature_2m }}
        rain: ${{ ACTIONS.get_weather.result.data.current.temperature_2m }}
      ```

      ![Reference action result](/img/quickstart/expressions/reference-action-result.png)

      You can then reference the `temp` and `rain` outputs in downstream actions in the workflow using:

      ```yaml
      ${{ ACTIONS.reshape.result.temp }}
      ${{ ACTIONS.reshape.result.rain }}
      ```
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

## `TRIGGER.` namespace

<Info>
  Check out the [triggers](/tutorials/triggers.mdx) tutorial for a detailed guide setting up webhooks for workflows.
</Info>

You can reference the payload of the webhook event that triggered the workflow using the `TRIGGER.` namespace.

For example,

```yaml
url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
method: GET
params:
  latitude: ${{ TRIGGER.lat }}
  longitude: ${{ TRIGGER.long }}
  current: temperature_2m,precipitation_probability
```

## `SECRETS.` namespace

<Info>
  Check out the [secrets](/tutorials/secrets) tutorial for a detailed guide on storing and referencing secrets in Tracecat.
</Info>

## `FN.` namespace

<Info>
  Check out the full list of supported functions in the [functions](/cheatsheet/functions) cheatsheet.
</Info>

Tracecat supports inline functions in the `FN.` namespace.
For example, you can use the `FN.deserialize_json` function to decode a JSON string into a JSON object.

```yaml
${{ FN.deserialize_json(ACTIONS.get_weather.result.data) }}
```
