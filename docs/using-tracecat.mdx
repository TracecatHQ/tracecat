Tracecat's flexible user interface that allows you to build workflows in **headless**
mode and view your workflows in the UI (**GUI** mode).

## Operational modes

| Mode               | User interface        | Editor                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GUI (graphical UI) | React+NextJS frontend | No-code drag-and-drop builder |
| Headless (no GUI)  | REST API or CLI       | IDE or text editor + YAML DSL |

Across all the documentation, when we refer to "the UI", we're talking about the any of the user interfaces.

## Headless mode

In headless mode, workflows are built and edited using your IDE or text editor with a YAML-like DSL. More on this in the [workflows](/concepts/workflows) section.
To operate Tracecat, this is done via the [REST API](/api-reference) or CLI. See the benefits of using YAML [here](/concepts/workflow-definitions#using-yaml).

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Tracecat's CLI thinly wraps around the REST API. It's built using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and requres Python to be installed.
We recommend using the CLI if you can, as it's a more user-friendly interface compared to hitting the API directly. Please refer to the [CLI installation](/installation#headless-mode-only) guide for more information.

_NOTE: We are working on making the CLI more portable._

## GUI mode

In graphical UI (GUI) mode, you use our React+NextJS frontend to create and edit workflows, manage secrets, and view logs.

### Workspace

The workspace is where you manage your workflows, secrets, and events.

#### Catalog

- The left side panel Where you'll find all available actions.
- Drag and drop an action block onto the workflow canvas.
- Custom UDFs can be configured to show up here.

#### Canvas

- Drag-and-drop builder UI for creating workflows.
- Drag an action block from the catalog onto the workflow canvas.
- If a canvas action is selected, clicking on a catalog action places and connects the new block.

#### Configuration Panel

- The right side panel that changes depending on the current selection.
- Select your action onto the canvas to open its configuration panel.
- Update the action name, description, and inputs here.
- Press `save` to save the action.

### Navbar

- Commit changes to the workflow.
- Enable or disable the workflow.

## Two-way sync

Actions taken and edits made in either headless or GUI mode are reflected in the other. A workflow created in headless mode will show up in the GUI, and vice versa.

<Tip>This two-way sync functionality is a work in progress.</Tip>
