## Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn:

- How to create new actions from **Action Templates** in the **Actions Registry**
- How to use **Action Templates** to create more powerful integrations
- How to update an existing **Action Template** across all workflows directly in the UI

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Quickstart](/tutorials/quickstart) tutorial
- Completed the [Control Flow](/tutorials/control-flow) tutorial

## Tutorial

<Steps>
    <Step title="Check out the Actions Registry">
        Go to the **Actions Registry** by clicking on the **Registry** tab back in the workflows view.
        ![Actions Registry](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/actions-registry.png)

        Actions are registered at the organization level and can be used across all workflows and workspaces.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clone existing Action Template">
        As seen in the previous [Control Flow](/tutorials/control-flow) tutorial,
        the `Search URL with VirusTotal` action returns a lot of data that we don't need.

        Let's clean this up by creating a new action from the existing `Search URL with VirusTotal` action template.

        ![Clone existing Action Template](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/clone-action-template.png)

        You notice that **Action Templates** are YAML configuration-as-code templates similar to GitHub Actions workflows:

        ![Action Template](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/vt-action-template.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure the new action">
        <Note>
            Use `secrets.<secret-name>.<secret-key>` to reference secrets and `steps.<step-key>.result` to reference results from previous steps.
        </Note>

        ![Configure new VirusTotal action](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/new-vt-action.png)

        Copy the following configuration into the YAML editor:

        ```yaml
        name: Get URL stats from VirusTotal
        namespace: tracecat
        title: Get URL stats from VirusTotal
        description: Get the stats for a given URL from VirusTotal
        ```

        You notice this new action returns a JSON object with the `url` and `stats` fields already extracted for us!
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the new action to the workflow">
        Delete the `Reshape` action named `Extract VirusTotal report`, then add the new `Get URL stats from VirusTotal` action to the workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the workflow">
        Click on the **Run** button to execute the workflow.

        ![Run workflow](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/run-new-action-workflow.png)

        You'll get the same result as the previous tutorial but with one less action cluttering up the UI.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Congrats!">
        You've successfully created a new **Action Template** to consolidate your workflow logic!
        Action templates should be used to create more powerful reusable integrations across workflows.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- **Action Templates** should contain logic for only one tool (e.g. VirusTotal).
- **Action Templates** should be simple and contain at most 2 actions or API calls.
- **Action Templates** should be reusable across workflows (e.g. Tag Slack user by email).
- **Action Templates** are most effective when used to normalize input and output data between tools.
- **Action Templates** are not mini-workflows.

## Next Steps

- Learn how to receive external events (e.g. from your SIEM) and configure schedules to trigger workflows. View the [tutorial on triggers](/tutorials/5-triggers).
- Check out the [tutorial on custom integrations](/tutorials/6-custom-integrations). Learn how to create version-controlled Python integrations and YAML Action Templates. All synced from your private GitHub repository.
