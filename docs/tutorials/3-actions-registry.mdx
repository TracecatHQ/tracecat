## Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn:

- How to create new actions from **Action Templates** in the **Actions Registry**
- How to use **Action Templates** to create more powerful integrations
- How to update an existing **Action Template** across all workflows directly in the UI

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Quickstart](/tutorials/quickstart) tutorial
- Completed the [Control Flow](/tutorials/control-flow) tutorial

## Tutorial

<Steps>
    <Step title="Check out the Actions Registry">
        Go to the **Actions Registry** by clicking on the **Registry** tab back in the workflows view.
        ![Actions Registry](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/actions-registry.png)

        Actions are registered at the organization level and can be used across all workflows and workspaces.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clone existing Action Template">
        Let's create a new action called `Is URL malicious`.
        First, find and clone the existing `Search URL with VirusTotal` action template by selecting **New from template** in Action Registry.
        ![Clone Template](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/clone-template.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Edit the new action">
        Edit the action to get the VirusTotal report, check if the URL is malicious, and return a single boolean value.
        Copy the following configuration into the YAML editor:

        ```yaml
        name: is_url_malicious
        namespace: integrations.virustotal
        title: Is URL malicious
        description: Check if URL is marked as malicious in the VirusTotal.
        display_group: VirusTotal
        secrets:
          - name: virustotal
            keys:
              - VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY
        expects:
          url:
            type: str
            description: The URL to search
        steps:
          - ref: is_url_malicious
            action: core.http_request
            args:
              url: https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/urls/${{
                FN.strip(FN.to_base64url(inputs.url), "=") }}
              method: GET
              headers:
                x-apikey: ${{ SECRETS.virustotal.VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY }}
        returns: ${{ FN.greater_than_or_equal(steps.is_url_malicious.result.data.data.attributes.last_analysis_stats.malicious, 1) }}
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace actions in workflow">
        Go back to `Enrich URL with VirusTotal` workflow and replace the `Search URL with VirusTotal` and `Extract VirusTotal report` actions with the new `Is URL malicious` action.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Remove the if-condition and update action result references">
        Remove the previously created if-condition from `List VirusTotal comments on URL` action **Control Flow** tab.

        Update the `List VirusTotal comments on URL` action Input to use the trigger URL:

        ```yaml
        url: ${{ TRIGGER.url }}
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Modify output data">
        Click on the canvas to view workflow settings, then go to the **Schema** tab.
        Modify the **Output Schema** to following:
        ```
        Url: ${{ TRIGGER.url }}
        Comment count: ${{ ACTIONS.list_virustotal_comments_on_url.result.data.meta.count }}
        Is URL malicious: ${{ ACTIONS.is_url_malicious.result }}
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the workflow">
        Click on the **Run** button to execute the workflow. Use the same sample payload:
        ```json
        {"url": "https://crowdstrikebluescreen.com"}
        ```
        The results will be similar to the previous tutorial.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Why use Action Templates?

Action templates allow you to:

- Define explicit input and output schemas for your integrations
- Combine actions into reusable pieces of tradecraft that aren't just API calls
- Build integrations that are easier to edit across workflows
- Declutter your workflows with fewer filler actions

## Best Practices

- **Action templates** should contain logic for only one integration.
- **Action templates** should be simple and contain at most three actions.
- **Action templates** should be used to normalize input and output data between actions.
- **Action templates** are not mini-workflows.

## Next Steps

- Learn how to combine smaller workflows into a single workflow. View the tutorial [here](/tutorials/4-child-workflows).
- Learn how to receive external events (e.g. from your SIEM) and configure schedules to trigger workflows. View the tutorial [here](/tutorials/5-triggers).
- Learn how to sync custom Python integrations from GitHub. View the tutorial [here](/tutorials/6-custom-integrations).
