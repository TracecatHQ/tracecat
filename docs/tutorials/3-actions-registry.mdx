## Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn:

- How to create new actions from **Action Templates** in the **Actions Registry**
- How to use **Action Templates** to create more powerful integrations
- How to update an existing **Action Template** across all workflows directly in the UI

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Quickstart](/tutorials/quickstart) tutorial
- Completed the [Control Flow](/tutorials/control-flow) tutorial

## Tutorial

<Steps>
    <Step title="Check out the Actions Registry">
        Go to the **Actions Registry** by clicking on the **Registry** tab back in the workflows view.
        ![Actions Registry](/img/tutorials/actions-registry/actions-registry.png)

        Actions are registered at the organization level and can be used across all workflows and workspaces.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clone existing Action Template">
        Let's create a new action called `Is URL malicious`.
        First, clone the existing `Search URL with VirusTotal` action template.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Edit the new action">
        Edit the action to get the VirusTotal report, check if the URL is malicious, and return a single boolean value.
        Copy the following configuration into the YAML editor:

        ```yaml
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace actions in workflow">
        Replace the `Search URL with VirusTotal` and `Extract VirusTotal report` actions with the new `Is URL malicious` action.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update action result references">
        We need to update the `List VirusTotal comments on URL` action to use the new `Is URL malicious` action.

        ```yaml
        ${{ ACTIONS.is_url_malicious.result }}
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the workflow">
        Click on the **Run** button to execute the workflow.
        The results will be the same as the previous tutorial.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Why use Action Templates?

Action templates allow you to:

- Define explicit input and output schemas for your integrations
- Combine actions into reusable pieces of tradecraft that aren't just API calls
- Build integrations that are easier to edit across workflows
- Declutter your workflows with fewer filler actions

## Best Practices

- **Action templates** should contain logic for only one integration.
- **Action templates** should be simple and contain at most three actions.
- **Action templates** should be used to normalize input and output data between actions.
- **Action templates** are not mini-workflows.

## Next Steps

- Learn how to combine smaller workflows into a single workflow. View the tutorial [here](/tutorials/4-child-workflows).
- Learn how to receive external events (e.g. from your SIEM) and configure schedules to trigger workflows. View the tutorial [here](/tutorials/5-triggers).
- Learn how to sync custom Python integrations from GitHub. View the tutorial [here](/tutorials/6-custom-integrations).
