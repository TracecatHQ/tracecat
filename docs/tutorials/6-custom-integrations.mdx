description: Learn how to add custom integrations to the Actions Registry.

<Tip>
    Looking for example Python and YAML-based (Action Template) integrations?
    Check out Tracecat's public integrations [here](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry).

    We recommend writing **Action Templates** over Python **UDFs** when building custom integrations.
    Find out the difference between the two [here](/platform/actions).
