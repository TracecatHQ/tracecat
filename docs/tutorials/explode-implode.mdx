## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Set up the **fetcher-processor** pattern to process lists of data.
- Create lookup tables with natural keys for upserts.

<Info>
  Benefits of the **fetcher-processor** pattern:

  1. Processor workflows can be reused by other fetcher workflows.
  2. Processor workflows can be tested in isolation with a single item.
  3. Fetcher workflows can be scheduled to run at specified intervals.
  4. Lower memory usage per workflow when processing large lists of data.
</Info>

## Fetcher-processor

This pattern consists of two workflows:
- A fetcher workflow that fetches a list of data (e.g. list of alerts).
- A processor workflow that receives and processes one item at a time (e.g. enrich alert and open a case)

It's easier to start with the processor workflow, which only processes one item at a time.
Once that's working, we can add the fetcher workflow that fetches a list of data and passes it to the processor workflow.

## Tutorial

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of Tracecat [for-loops](/quickstart/control-flow) and [child workflows](/tutorials/child-workflows)
- [URLScan](https://urlscan.io/docs/api/) and [URLHaus](https://urlhaus-api.abuse.ch/) abuse.ch API keys added as Tracecat secrets.
- A table with `url` (text), `download` (jsonb), `asn` (jsonb), and `geoip` (jsonb) columns. `url` as the index.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API keys" icon="key">
    Add the URLScan and URLHaus API keys as Tracecat secrets.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Processor workflow">
    In the following example, we assume the workflow receives a `url` field from the `TRIGGER`,
    then looks up the URL with URLScan and extracts important fields.

    ![Processor workflow](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/processor-workflow.png)
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Lookup URL with URLScan" icon="magnifying-glass">
          Pass `TRIGGER.url` into `tools.urlscan.lookup_url` action.
          ![Lookup URL](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/lookup-url.png)
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Extract important fields" icon="list-check">
        Use a reshape action to extract `download`, `asn`, and `geoip` from the URLScan result.
        ![Extract important fields](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/extract-fields.png)
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Upsert data to a table" icon="database">
        Upsert data into the `url_blocklist` table created as part of the prerequisites.
        ![Upsert data](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/upsert-data.png)
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetcher workflow">
    In the following example, we fetch a list of URLs from URLHaus and pass them to the processor workflow.

    ![Fetcher workflow](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/fetcher-workflow.png)

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Fetch data from URLHaus" icon="at">
        Fetch data from URLHaus using the [URLHaus](https://urlhaus-api.abuse.ch/) integration.
        ![Fetch data](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/fetch-data.png)
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Filter data" icon="filter">
        For demonstration purposes, we filter for URLs that are tagged with `elf`.
        ![Filter data](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/filter-data.png)
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Define looped workflow" icon="rotate-right">
        Select the `core.workflow.execute` action, then define the following loop expression:
        ![Loop](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/loop.png)
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Define workflow inputs" icon="person-running">
        Define the workflow execution action by setting:
        - `workflow_alias`: to the alias of the processor workflow
        - `trigger_inputs`: as an object with a single `url` field
        ![Execute workflow](/img/tutorials/explode-implode/execute-workflow.png)
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lookup table">
    Go to tables to view the results of the processor workflow.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Add new workflow logic into the processor workflow.
- If the processor workflow gets too large, use child workflows in the processor workflow to split it into smaller ones.
- The fetcher workflow should only be used to fetch data and (optionally) filter them into different processor workflows.

<Tip>
  To implement branching logic (similar to if-conditions) with lists of data, use `core.transform.filter` or JSONPath filters.

  - Learn about the filter action in the [data transforms](/tutorials/data-transforms#filter) tutorial.
  - Learn about JSONPath filters in the [JSONPath](/cheatsheet/jsonpath#basic-filters) cheatsheet.
</Tip>

### Use cases

Common **processor workflows** include:

- Normalizing a single alert (e.g. renaming fields)
- Enriching indicators of compromise (IoCs) in a single alert
- Opening a single case in a ticketing system (Tracecat cases, Jira, etc.)

These processor workflows can be reused by different **fetcher workflows**.
Examples of fetcher workflows include:

- Ingesting alerts from a SIEM
- Ingesting indicators from a threat intelligence platform
