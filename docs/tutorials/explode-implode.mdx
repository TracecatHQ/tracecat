## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up the **fetcher-processor** pattern to process lists of data.

<Note>
    Though the **fetcher-processor** pattern requires two workflows, it is a powerful pattern as:

    1. Processor workflows can be reused by other fetcher workflows.
    2. Processor workflows can be tested in isolation with a single item.
    3. Fetcher workflows can be scheduled to run at specified intervals.
    4. Commonly used in data pipelines at scale.
</Note>

## Fetcher-processor

The fetcher-processor pattern consists of two workflows:
- A fetcher workflow that fetches a list of data (e.g. list of alerts).
- A processor workflow that receives and processes one item at a time (e.g. enrich alert and open a case)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Fetcher workflow" icon="layer-group">
        Fetch a list of data from an external source.
        In this example, we fetch a list of URLs from a file.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Processor workflow" icon="">
        Process each item in the list.
        In this example, we enrich each URL and open a case.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Use cases

<Tip>
    To implement branching logic (similar to if-conditions) with lists of data, use `core.transform.filter` or JSONPath filters.

    - Learn about the filter action in the [data transforms](/tutorials/data-transforms#filter) tutorial.
    - Learn about JSONPath filters in the [JSONPath](/cheatsheet/jsonpath#basic-filters) cheatsheet.
</Tip>

Common **processor workflows** include:

- Normalizing a single alert (e.g. renaming fields)
- Enriching indicators of compromise (IoCs) in a single alert
- Opening a single case in a ticketing system (Tracecat cases, Jira, etc.)

These processor workflows can be reused by different **fetcher workflows**.
Examples of fetcher workflows include:

- Ingesting alerts from a SIEM
- Ingesting indicators from a threat intelligence platform
