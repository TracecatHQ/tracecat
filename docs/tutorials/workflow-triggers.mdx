<Note>
  This tutorial does not cover how to expose your Tracecat instance to the public internet.

  - If you're running Tracecat locally, you'll need use a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to receive webhook requests from the public internet.
  - If you're running Tracecat on AWS Fargate, Tracecat is automatically exposed to the public internet via an Application Load Balancer.
</Note>

<Info>
  Use the `${{ TRIGGER }}` expression context to reference data passed via webhooks.
  A child workflow also receives input data via `${{ TRIGGER }}` context.

  Learn more in the [child workflows](/tutorials/child-workflows) and [expressions](/quickstart/expressions#trigger-context) docs.
</Info>

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to create two types of workflows:

- A webhook workflow that receives a JSON string and decodes it using the `FN.deserialize_json` function.
- A scheduled workflow that sends a notification to a Slack channel at a regular interval.

## Trigger Action

Every Tracecat workflow comes with a single `Trigger` action.
This trigger action cannot be deleted.
Click on the `Trigger` action to activate the webhooks and schedules configuration panel.

## Webhook workflow

<Warning>
  Webhook URLs are **secrets** and should not be exposed in public.
  The webhook URL shown in the UI screenshots are for demonstration only.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Webhooks currently support the following content types:
  - `application/json`
  - `application/x-ndjson`
  - `application/www-form-urlencoded`
</Note>

Webhooks are disabled by default. To activate a workflow's webhook, click on the `Trigger` action, toggle the webhook on, then enable the workflow.
Webhook URLs are formatted as:

```bash
https://<tracecat-public-url>/api/webhooks/<workflow-id>/<webhook-secret>
```

Use the `${{ TRIGGER }}` expression context to reference data from the webhook payload.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deserialize JSON action">
    Add the `core.transform.reshape` action to the workflow.
    Use the `FN.deserialize_json` function to decode an incoming JSON string via webhook.

    ```yaml
    value: ${{ FN.deserialize_json(TRIGGER.payload)}}
    ```

    ![Deserialize JSON action](/img/tutorials/triggers/deserialize-json.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle webhook">
    Click on the `Trigger` action.
    Enable the webhook by clicking on the toggle switch.

    ![Toggle webhook](/img/tutorials/triggers/toggle-webhook.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable workflow">
    Save the workflow, then press the `Enable workflow` button for the webhook to start receiving requests.

    ![Enable workflow](/img/tutorials/triggers/enable-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="POST webhook request">
    Copy the webhook URL to your clipboard, then make a `POST` request to the webhook URL.
    For example, using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"payload": "{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}"}' \
      <webhook-url>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="View workflow runs">
    Go to the `Runs` view and check that the workflow has run successfully.
    The workflow should have received the webhook payload and deserialized it into a JSON object.

## Scheduled workflow

This tutorial requires:

- A Slack workspace with a Slack app installed into a channel.
- The Slack app has the `chat:write` bot token scope.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Post notification action">
    Add the Slack `Post notification` action to the workflow.
    Don't forget to add your Slack bot token as a [workspace secret](/quickstart/secrets).
    This secret must be named `slack` with the key `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.

    <Accordion title="Sample inputs" icon="code">
      For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll hardcode the inputs for the `Post notification` action.
      Replace the `channel` value with your Slack channel ID.

      ```yaml
      channel: <your-slack-channel-id>
      choices:
        - ":white_check_mark: Confirm"
        - ":x: Deny"

    </Step>
    <Step title="Schedule workflow">
      Add the `Schedule` trigger to the workflow.

      ![Schedule trigger](/img/tutorials/triggers/schedule.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure schedule">
      Configure the schedule to run every 60 seconds.

      ![Schedule form](/img/tutorials/triggers/schedule-form.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable workflow">
      Save the workflow, then press the `Enable workflow` button for the schedule to start running.

    <Step title="View workflow runs">
      You can view the workflow runs in the `Runs` view.

      ![Workflow runs](/img/tutorials/triggers/workflow-runs.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Pause or delete schedule">
      You can pause or delete the schedule by selecting the schedule menu in the `Trigger` settings panel.
