<Tip>
  Get started by cloning the [custom-integrations-starter-kit](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/custom-integrations-starter-kit) template repo.
</Tip>

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Build custom integrations in YAML and Python
- Version control your integrations with Git
- Sync custom integrations into Tracecat
- Use custom integrations in workflows

## Prerequisites

- Access to a private Git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab)
- Basic knowledge of Python, [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/), and YAML

## YAML Action Templates

<Tip>
  Check out Tracecat's open source [Action Templates](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates) on GitHub for examples.
  More information on when and how to build effective templates can be found in the [integrations best practices](/integrations/best-practices) docs.
</Tip>

If you find yourself using a generic action (e.g. `core.http_request`) with the same parameters in multiple workflows, we recommend creating a YAML action template.

Every **Action Template** follows the same structure:

```yaml
type: action
definition:
  title: <title>
  description: <description>
  display_group: <display_group>
  doc_url: <doc_url>
  namespace: <namespace>
  name: <name>
  secrets:  # Secrets are optional
    - name: <secret_name>
      keys:
        - <key_name>
      optional_keys:
        - <key_name>
  expects:
    <param_name>:
      type: <type>
      description: <description>
      default: <default_value>  # Optional
  steps:
    - ref: <step_id>
      action: <action_namespace>.<action_name>
      args:
        <param_name>: <param_value>
  returns: <returns>
```

Secrets used in templates must be defined in the `secrets` section.
They are retrieved from Tracecat's secrets manager at runtime.

### Actions in templates

Templates support all actions defined in the **Tracecat Registry**.
Actions, such as `core.http_request` and `tools.falconpy.call_command`, can all be used in templates by specifying the `steps.action` field.

### Expressions in templates

Templates support the following expressions:

- `inputs`: Reference inputs into the action as defined in the `expects` section.
- `steps`: Reference results from previous steps in the same template.
- `SECRETS`: Reference secrets.
- `FN`: Reference functions.

`inputs` and `steps` are expressions specific to templates.
`SECRETS` and `FN` are used in the same way as in workflows.

This means that templates have full support for Tracecat's powerful [inline functions](/quickstart/expressions).
For example:

```yaml
${{ FN.to_isoformat(inputs.start_time) }}
${{ FN.strip(FN.to_base64url(inputs.url), "=") }}
```

## Python UDFs

<Tip>
  Check out Tracecat's open source [Python integrations](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/integrations) on GitHub for examples.
</Tip>

Tracecat makes it easy to turn your Python scripts into no-code workflow actions, which we call **user-defined functions (UDFs)**.
All you need is a single Python decorator.


<Note>
  To run and test your Python UDFs locally, you need to install [`tracecat_registry`](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry).

  [custom-integrations-starter-kit](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/custom-integrations-starter-kit) makes this easy.
  All you need to do is specify `dev` dependencies when installing the project.

  ```bash
  cd custom-integrations-starter-kit
  pip install -e ".[dev]"
  ```
</Note>
