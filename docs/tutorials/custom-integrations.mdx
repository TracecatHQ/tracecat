<Tip>
  Get started by cloning the [custom-integrations-starter-kit](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/custom-integrations-starter-kit) template repo.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Git sync is the recommended way to sync custom integrations into Tracecat in production.
  For development,
</Note>

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Sync custom integrations into Tracecat
- Build custom integrations in YAML and Python

## Prerequisites

- Access to a private Git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab)
- Basic knowledge of Python, [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/), and YAML

## Sync remote git repository

In this section, we'll walk through the process of securely syncing custom integrations into Tracecat.

<Steps>
  <CreateNewRepoStep />
  <Step title="Configure remote repo URL">
    Go to the `Git repository` section in `Organization` settings and configure the remote repo URL to point to your private repository.

  </Step>
  <Step title="GitHub SSH deploy key">
    Create a SSH public / private key pair (without a passphrase) and store the public key in GitHub.
    Store the public key in GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Private key in Tracecat">
    Go to the `SSH keys` section in `Organizations` settings and add the private key with the name `github-ssh-key`.

    <Note>
      Do not change the key name. The `github-ssh-key` key name works for both GitHub and GitLab.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh repos in Tracecat">
    Go to the `Repositories` section in the `Registry` page and refresh the repos.
    Your custom repo should now be visible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync custom repo">
    In the same `Repositories` section, select your custom repo and press the `Sync from remote`.
    Your custom integrations should now be visible in your Tracecat instance's registry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View custom integrations">
    Go to the `Actions` view in the `Registry` page and filter by `Origin` to view synced actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="ðŸŽ‰ That's it!">
    Feel free to add your own custom Python UDFs and YAML templates to the custom integrations repo.

    Just push to your changes to the git repo and press sync in Tracecat Registry.
    Updates and new actions will show up immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Action Templates

<Tip>
  If you find yourself using a generic action (e.g. `core.http_request`) with the same parameters in multiple workflows, we recommend creating a YAML action template.

  Check out Tracecat's open source [Action Templates](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates) on GitHub for examples.
  More information on when and how to build effective templates can be found in the [integrations best practices](/integrations/best-practices).

## Python UDFs

<Tip>
  Check out Tracecat's open source [core actions](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/base/core)
  and [Python integrations](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/integrations) on GitHub for examples.
