## What you'll learn

- How wait until some time (e.g. "tomorrow 2pm") before running an action.
- How to use the `FN.is_working_hours` inline function.
- How to use the `core.require` action to check conditions.
- How to retry a child workflow until a condition is met.

## Wait until

Under the if-conditions tab of any action, you can configure a `wait_until` condition.
This condition takes a human-readable string (e.g. "tomorrow 2pm") and waits until that time.

You can specify relative dates, for example:
- `tomorrow at 2pm`
- `in 2 days`

Or absolute dates, for example:
- `2025-05-01 at 2pm`
- `March 21st 2025 at 10am`

<Info>
  Under-the-hood, we use the `dateparser` library to parse the human-readable string.
  View `dateparser` docs [here](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Require

<Note>
  Require accepts expressions similar to `if-conditions`.
  Learn more about conditional expressions [here](/docs/quickstart/control-flow#if-conditions).
  View all available operators (e.g. `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) [here](/cheatsheets/functions#operators).
</Note>

The `core.require` action checks if any or all of multiple conditions are met.
It takes three arguments:
- `conditions`: A list of expressions that evaluate to booleans e.g. `FN.length(ACTIONS.some_action.result.some_array) > 0`
- `raise_error`: If `true`, the workflow will fail if the conditions (all or any) are not met.
- `require_all`: If `true`, all conditions must be met for the workflow to continue. If `false`, only one condition needs to be met.

![Require](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/require.png)

For example, the following `core.require` action fails if the length of the `some_array` is greater than 0 and `email` is equal to "john@acme.com".

```php
conditions:
  - ${{ FN.length(ACTIONS.some_action.result.some_array) > 0 }}
  - ${{ ACTIONS.some_action.result.email == "john@acme.com" }}
```

![Require example](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/require-example.png)

## Retry until

<Note>
  Child workflows return the full context of the workflow run (e.g. action inputs and outputs) by default.
  This is not easy to work with when using `retry_until`.

  Specify an output schema for the child workflow to return specific data from the workflow run.
  Learn more about output schemas in the child workflows tutorial [here](/tutorials/child-workflows#output-schema).
</Note>

Under the if-conditions tab of any action, you can configure a `retry_until` condition.
To make use of this condition, define a conditional expression on the same action's result.

For example, the following execute child workflow action will retry until the child workflow returns an `ack` field with a value of `true`:

```php
retry_until: ${{ ACTIONS.send_reminder.result.ack == True }}
```

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll build two workflows:

- A workflow that notifies a user on Slack during working hours only.
- A workflow that reminds a user on Slack to react to a message with a thumbs up emoji.

### Prerequisites

- A Slack bot token and channel to send messages to.
- Slack token has the following OAuth scopes:

<Accordion title="Slack OAuth scopes" icon="slack">
  ![Slack OAuth scopes](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/slack-oauth-scopes.png)
</Accordion>

### Workflow 1. Alert if working

In the following workflow, we assume that the webhook or manual trigger receives a payload with an `email` field.
The email must be an user in Slack.

For example:

```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  // ... other fields
}
```

![Alert if working hours](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/alert-working-hours.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Lookup user by email">
    Select and configure the `tools.slack.lookup_user_by_email` action.
    ![Lookup user](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/lookup-user.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify today if working">
    Select the `tools.slack.post_message` action.
    Configure inputs:

    ```yaml
    text: >
      Hi <@${{ ACTIONS.lookup_user_by_email.result.id }}>,
      please acknowledge this message with a thumbs up 👍!
    channel: C0YOURSLACKCHANNEL
    ```

    And the if-condition:

    ```php
    ${{ FN.is_working_hours(FN.now(), "09:00", "17:00") == True }}
    ```

    ![Notify today](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/notify-today.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify tomorrow if not working">
    Select the `tools.slack.post_message` action.
    Configure inputs:

    ```yaml
    text: >
      Hi <@${{ ACTIONS.lookup_user_by_email.result.id }}>,
      an alert was triggered during off-hours yesterday.

      Please acknowledge this message with a thumbs up 👍!
    channel: C0YOURSLACKCHANNEL
    ```

    And the if-condition:

    ```php
    ${FN.is_working_hours(FN.now(), "09:00", "17:00") == False}
    ```

    ![Notify tomorrow](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/notify-tomorrow.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="⚠️ Send reminder until acknowledged">
    Let's configure a `core.workflow.execute` action that executes workflow 2 (to be built next).

    ```yaml
    workflow_alias: send_reminder
    trigger_inputs:
      thread_ts: ${{ ACTIONS.notify_today.result.ts || ACTIONS.notify_tomorrow.result.ts }}
      user_tag: <@${{ ACTIONS.lookup_user_by_email.result.id }}>
    ```

    ![Execute remind user](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/execute-remind-user.png)

    And the `retry_until` condition:

    ```php
    retry_until: ${{ ACTIONS.send_reminder.result.ack == True }}
    ```

    ![Retry until](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/retry-until.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Workflow 2. Send reminder

In this workflow, we'll build a workflow that takes an input with two fields:
- `thread_ts`: The timestamp of the thread to send the reminder to.
- `user_tag`: The Slack user tag (e.g. `<@U0123456789>`) of the user to send the reminder to.
- `user_id`: The Slack user ID (e.g. `U0123456789`) of the user to send the reminder to.

And returns an output with a single field:
- `ack`: A boolean field that indicates if the user has acknowledged the reminder.

Set the workflow alias to `send_reminder`.

![Send reminder](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/send-reminder.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send reminder">
    Select and configure the `tools.slack.post_message` action.

    ```yaml
    channel: C0YOURSLACKCHANNEL
    text: ${{ TRIGGER.user_tag }} please acknowledge this alert.
    thread_ts: ${{ TRIGGER.thread_ts }}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get all reactions to the original message">
    Select and configure the `tools.slack.get_reactions` action.

    ```yaml
    channel: C0YOURSLACKCHANNEL
    timestamp: ${{ TRIGGER.thread_ts }}
    ```

    Configure a reasonable `start_delay` to check for a response after some time.
    In this example, we wait 120 seconds before checking for a response.

    ![Start delay](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/start-delay.png)

    The `tools.slack.get_reactions` action returns a response like this:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "thumbsup",
        "users": [
          "W222222"
        ],
        "count": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "question",
        "users": [
          "W333333"
        ],
        "count": 1
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter out users who thumbed up">
    Select and configure the `core.transform.filter` action.

    Configure inputs:

    ```yaml
    items: ${{ ACTIONS.get_reactions.result }}
    python_lambda: >
      lambda x: x.get(''name'') == "thumbsup"
    ```

    With if-condition:

    ```php
    ${{ FN.length(ACTIONS.get_reactions.result) > 0 }}
    ```

    ![Filter thumbs up](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/filter-thumbs-up.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluate ack condition">
    Select and configure the `core.require` action and rename it to `Ack`.

    Configure inputs:

    ```yaml
    raise_error: false
    conditions:
    - ${{ FN.length(ACTIONS.filter_thumbs_up.result) > 0 }}
    - ${{ TRIGGER.user_id in ACTIONS.filter_thumbs_up.result[0].users }}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define output schema">
    Go to the `Schema` tab of workflow settings.
    Define the following output schema for the workflow.

    ```yaml
    ack: ${{ ACTIONS.ack.result }}
    ```

    ![Output schema](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/output-schema.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

🎉 Congratulations! You've built two workflows that work together to notify a user on Slack during working hours only.
Try this out by manually triggering the alert if working workflow with the following payload:

```json
{
  // Some user in Slack
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

The `send_reminder` workflow will:

- Send a reminder to the user on Slack.
- Wait 120 seconds for a reaction.
- And keep retrying until the user reacts with a thumbs up.
