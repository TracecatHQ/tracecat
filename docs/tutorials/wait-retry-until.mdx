title: Wait, require, and retry
description: Define wait until, require, and retry until logic in workflows.
---

## What you'll learn

- How wait until some time (e.g. "tomorrow 2pm") before running an action.
- How to use the `FN.is_working_hours` inline function.
- How to use the `core.require` action to check conditions.
- How to retry a child workflow until a condition is met.

## Wait until

Under the if-conditions tab of any action, you can configure a `wait_until` condition.
This condition takes a human-readable string (e.g. "tomorrow 2pm") and waits until that time.

You can specify relative dates, for example:
- `tomorrow at 2pm`
- `in 2 days`

Or absolute dates, for example:
- `2025-05-01 at 2pm`
- `March 21st 2025 at 10am`

<Info>
  Under-the-hood, we use the `dateparser` library to parse the human-readable string.
  View `dateparser` docs [here](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Require

<Note>
  Require accepts expressions similar to `if-conditions`.
  Learn more about conditional expressions [here](/docs/quickstart/control-flow#if-conditions).
  View all available operators (e.g. `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) [here](/cheatsheets/functions#operators).
</Note>

The `core.require` action checks if any or all of multiple conditions are met.
It takes three arguments:
- `conditions`: A list of expressions that evaluate to booleans e.g. `FN.length(ACTIONS.some_action.result.some_array) > 0`
- `raise_error`: If `true`, the workflow will fail if the conditions (all or any) are not met.
- `require_all`: If `true`, all conditions must be met for the workflow to continue. If `false`, only one condition needs to be met.

![Require](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/require.png)

For example, the following `core.require` action fails if the length of the `some_array` is greater than 0 and `email` is equal to "john@acme.com".

```php
conditions:
  - ${{ FN.length(ACTIONS.some_action.result.some_array) > 0 }}
  - ${{ ACTIONS.some_action.result.email == "john@acme.com" }}
```

## Retry until

<Note>
  Child workflows return the full context of the workflow run (e.g. action inputs and outputs) by default.
  This is not easy to work with when using `retry_until`.

  Specify an output schema for the child workflow to return specific data from the workflow run.
  Learn more about output schemas in the child workflows tutorial [here](/tutorials/child-workflows#output-schema).
</Note>

Under the if-conditions tab of any action, you can configure a `retry_until` condition.
To make use of this condition, define a conditional expression on the same action's result.

For example, the following execute child workflow action will retry until the child workflow returns an `ack` field with a value of `true`:

```php
retry_until: ${{ ACTIONS.send_reminder.result.ack == True }}
```

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll build two workflows:

- A workflow that notifies a user on Slack during working hours only.
- A workflow that reminds a user on Slack to react to a message with a thumbs up emoji.

### Prerequisites

- A Slack bot token and channel to send messages to.
- Slack token has the following OAuth scopes:

<Accordion title="Slack OAuth scopes" icon="slack">
  ![Slack OAuth scopes](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/slack-oauth-scopes.png)
</Accordion>

### Workflow 1. Alert if working

In the following workflow, we assume that the webhook or manual trigger receives a payload with an `email` field.
The email must be an user in Slack.

For example:

```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  // ... other fields
}
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Lookup user by email">
    Select and configure the `tools.slack.lookup_user_by_email` action.
    ![Lookup user](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/lookup-user.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify today if working">
    Select the `tools.slack.post_message` action.
    Configure inputs:

    ```yaml
    text: >
      Hi <@${{ ACTIONS.lookup_user_by_email.result.id }}>,
      please acknowledge this message with a thumbs up üëç!
    channel: C0YOURSLACKCHANNEL
    ```

    And the if-condition:

    ```php
    ${{ FN.is_working_hours(FN.now(), "09:00", "17:00") == True }}
    ```

    ![Notify today](/img/tutorials/wait-retry-until/notify-today.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify tomorrow if not working">
    Select the `tools.slack.post_message` action.
    Configure inputs:

    ```yaml
    text: >
      Hi <@${{ ACTIONS.lookup_user_by_email.result.id }}>,
      an alert was triggered during off-hours yesterday.

      Please acknowledge this message with a thumbs up üëç!
    channel: C0YOURSLACKCHANNEL
    ```

    And the if-condition:

    ```php
    ${FN.is_working_hours(FN.now(), "09:00", "17:00") == False}
    ```

### Workflow 2. Send reminder
