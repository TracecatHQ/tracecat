<Note>
  This tutorial does not cover how to expose your Tracecat instance to the public internet.

  - If you're running Tracecat locally, you'll need use a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to receive webhook requests from the public internet.
  - If you're running Tracecat on AWS Fargate, Tracecat is automatically exposed to the public internet via an Application Load Balancer.
</Note>

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to create two types of workflows:

- A scheduled workflow that sends a notification to a Slack channel at a regular interval.
- A webhook workflow that receives an encoded file string then processes it using the Tracecat's built-in `Cyberchef` action.

## Prerequisites

- A Slack workspace with a Slack app installed into a channel.
- The Slack app has the `chat:write` bot token scope.

## Scheduled workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Post notification action">
    Add the Slack `Post notification` action to the workflow.

    <Accordion title="Sample inputs" icon="code">
      For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll hardcode the inputs for the `Post notification` action.
      Replace the `channel` value with your Slack channel ID.

      ```yaml
      channel: <your-slack-channel-id>
      choices:
        - ":white_check_mark: Confirm"
        - ":x: Deny"
