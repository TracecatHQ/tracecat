description: Learn how to safely update versions and run data migrations.

<Note>
  Updates and data migrations can be tricky business. We'd love to help on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8).
</Note>

<Warning>
  If you want to migrate secrets, please make sure to save your database
  encryption / decryption Fernet key. You can find this key in your `.env` file
  assigned to the environment variable: `TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
</Warning>

## Docker Compose

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download latest environment variables migration script and template">
    Fetch the latest environment variables migration script `env-migration.sh`
    and template `.env.example` to ensure compatibility with the new Tracecat
    version.

    ```
    curl -o env-migration.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.14.5/env-migration.sh
    curl -o .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.14.5/.env.example
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute environment variables migration">
    Run the environment variables migration script to update your existing
    `.env` file with any new or changed variables.

    ```
    chmod +x env-migration.sh && ./env-migration.sh
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Docker Compose Configuration">
    Download the latest Docker Compose file.

    ```
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.14.5/docker-compose.yml
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Tracecat">
    Run `docker compose up` using the new Docker Compose and `.env` files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update Integrations

Integrations are not automatically updated when you update the Tracecat version.
You will need to manually sync the Tracecat registry repository from the **Action Registry** page:

## Terraform Deployments

All of Tracecat's Cloud deployments are configured using Terraform.
To update Tracecat, you can download the latest Terraform stack from Tracecat's GitHub repo and run `terraform apply`.

## Data Migration

As of version 0.8.x, data migrations are automatically applied when the API service is spun up.
Data migrations are, however, non-trivial operations.
We recommend backing up your database before running migrations, especially in a production environment.

<Note>
If the API service fails to spin up due to a data migration error, do not worry.
Your data is still intact. Make sure you backup the core Tracecat database:

- For Docker Compose and AWS EC2 deployments, this would be the `core-db` volume in Tracecat's Docker stack.
- For AWS ECS Fargate deployments, backups are created automatically as part of the RDS postgres service. Just run `terraform apply` with `var.restore_from_backup` set to `true` to restore the latest RDS snapshot.
