Lookup tables are a great way to store and retrieve data gathered from your workflows.
Tracecat also provides a UI to create, view, and edit lookup tables.

Use lookup tables to:

- Store data that pass through workflows (e.g. IP addresses, URLs, user agents) in a tabular format
- Upload reference tables (e.g. list of users, detection rules) via the UI and use them in workflows
- Share data between workflows

## Tables in the UI

### Create a table

Select the plus icon to create a new table.
Give your table a unique name along with one or more columns.
Each column must have a unique name. We support the following column types:

- `text`: max 65k characters
- `integer`: whole numbers
- `decimal`: floating point numbers
- `boolean`: true or false
- `jsonb`: JSON objects

### Add columns

### Add rows

### Upload CSV

## Tables in workflows

In this tutorial, we will scrape malicious URLs from [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/), defang them, and store them in a lookup table.
