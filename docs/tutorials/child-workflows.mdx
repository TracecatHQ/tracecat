<Note>
  Tracecat will always support unlimited workflows.
  We recommend breaking up your workflows into smaller, reusable workflows whenever possible.
</Note>


By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Call a workflow from another workflow
- Give a workflow a human-readable `alias`
- Use `trigger_input` to pass data into a child workflow
- Use `Output Schema` to define the data returned from a child workflow

## Execute child workflow

Use the `core.workflow.execute` action to call a workflow from another workflow.
You can call a workflow by `workflow_alias` (recommended) or by `workflow_id`.

### Alias

Give your workflows an `alias` to call them by a human-readable name, in `core.workflow.execute`, as opposed to the workflow ID.

### Trigger Inputs

<Tip>
  In the [workflow triggers](/docs/workflows/triggers) tutorial, we learned how to pass data into workflows via webhook payloads.
  Passing data into child workflows works the same way.
</Tip>

To pass data into a child workflow, specify `trigger_inputs` in the `core.workflow.execute` action's inputs.
`trigger_inputs` takes a JSON-serializable object exactly like webhook payloads.

For example, the `core.workflow.execute` action inputs might be configured as:

```yaml
workflow_alias: get_weather
trigger_inputs:
  latitude: 37.773972
  longitude: -122.431297
```

### Output Schema

<Tip>
  We recommend users define an `Output Schema` for every workflow.
</Tip>

<Note>
  You can use all core expression contexts: e.g. `ACTIONS`, `TRIGGER`, `FN` within the `Output Schema` field.
</Note>

By default, workflows return a JSON object that contains the entire workflow context.
The workflow context includes the inputs and outputs of every action from the workflow run.

You almost never want to return the entire workflow context as the output of a workflow.
The `Output Schema` field under the `Schemas` tab in workflow settings allows you to define the data returned from a workflow.

![Output Schema](/img/tutorials/child-workflows/output-schema.png)

The data returned from a workflow can be any JSON-serializable value.
For example, the `Output Schema` field can be configured as a nested JSON object:

```yaml
temperature: ${{ ACTIONS.http_request.result.data.current.temperature_2m }}
coordinates:
  lat: ${{ TRIGGER.latitude }}
  long: ${{ TRIGGER.longitude }}
timestamp: ${{ ACTIONS.http_request.result.data.time }}
```

or even a single value:

```yaml
${{ ACTIONS.http_request.result.data.current.temperature_2m }}
```

## Tutorial

<Info>
  This tutorial assumes you've already completed the [Quickstart](/quickstart/tutorial) tutorial.
</Info>

In the [quickstart](/quickstart/tutorial) tutorial, we built a workflow called `Get weather` that calls a weather API for the temperature.
Let's build another workflow that calls the `Get weather` workflow for three different locations (New York, London, and Tokyo).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Parameterize child workflow">
    We currently hardcode the coordinates in the `Get weather` workflow.
    Let's change this so that we can pass in coordinates from the webhook trigger into the `HTTP Request` action.

    ```yaml
    url: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
    method: GET
    params:
      latitude: ${{ TRIGGER.latitude }}  # Was 37.773972
      longitude: ${{ TRIGGER.longitude }}  # Was -122.431297
      current: temperature_2m
    ```

    ![Latitude and longitude trigger inputs](/img/tutorials/child-workflows/lat-long-trigger.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create parent workflow">
    Create a new workflow.
    Add three `core.workflow.execute` actions to the workflow, one for each location.
    Configure each `core.workflow.execute` action to call the `Get weather` workflow (with alias `get_weather`) with the appropriate coordinates.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```yaml New York
      workflow_alias: get_weather
      trigger_inputs:
        latitude: 40.7128
        longitude: 74.0060
      ```

      ```yaml London
      workflow_alias: get_weather
      trigger_inputs:
        latitude: 51.5072
        longitude: 0.1276
      ```

      ```yaml Tokyo
      workflow_alias: get_weather
      trigger_inputs:
        latitude: 35.6764
        longitude: 139.6500
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ![Parent workflow](/img/tutorials/child-workflows/parent-workflow.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run parent workflow">
    Run the parent workflow.
    Notice in `Action result` that the child workflow returns the entire workflow context as the output of the parent workflow.
    In this next step, we'll add an `Output Schema` to the `Get weather` child workflow to return only the temperature.

        ![View action result](/img/tutorials/child-workflows/view-action-result.png)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add output schema">
    Add an `Output Schema` to the `Get weather` workflow.
    Configure the `Output Schema` to return only the temperature.
    Save the workflow.

    ```yaml
    ${{ ACTIONS.http_request.result.data.current.temperature_2m }}
    ```

    ![Return value](/img/tutorials/child-workflows/return-value.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rerun parent workflow">
    Run the parent workflow again.
    Notice in `Action result` that the child workflow now returns only the temperature.
