description: Deploy Tracecat into your own Cloud
---

Self-hosting Tracecat lets you retain data on your own Cloud infrastructure and network.
Only AWS is currently supported, but we plan to support Azure and GCP in the near future.

## AWS

Tracecat supports deployment to AWS via a CDK (Cloud Development Kit) stack written in Python.
For security purposes, we require self-hosted Cloud users to request access to the deployment script via founders@tracecat.com email.

Tracecat's AWS deployment includes the following resources:
- 1 VPC
- 1 AmazonMQ Broker
- 2 ECS Fargate Services
- 1 Application Load Balancer
- 1 S3 Bucket
- 1 AmazonMQ Broker
- 1 Firewall (optional)
- Multiple Security Groups
- Multiple Logs Groups

## Azure

Coming soon!

## GCP

Coming soon!
