description: Deploy Tracecat into your own Cloud
---

Self-hosting Tracecat lets you retain data on your own Cloud infrastructure and network.
Only AWS is currently supported, but we plan to support Azure and GCP in the near future.

## AWS

Tracecat supports deployment to AWS via a CDK (Cloud Development Kit) stack written in Python.
For security purposes, we require self-hosted Cloud users to request access to the deployment script via founders@tracecat.com email.

Tracecat's AWS deployment includes the following resources:

- 1 VPC
- 1 AmazonMQ Broker
- 2 ECS Fargate Services
- 1 Application Load Balancer
- 1 S3 Bucket
- 1 AmazonMQ Broker
- 1 Firewall (optional)
- Multiple Security Groups
- Multiple Logs Groups

## Azure

Coming soon!

## GCP

Coming soon!

## Authentication

Tracecat supports Enterprise SSO via Clerk.

So far, we've shown how to run Tracecat locally without authentication and running with a default user.

If you want to enable authentication, you can set the `TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH` environment variable to `false` or `0` in the `.env` file. This requires you to have a Clerk account and set up the Clerk environment variables in `.env`.

```bash
# --- Authentication + Clerk ---
TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH=0
# Fill these in!
CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
```

Finally, you will need to add custom claims to your sessions - follow the steps in [this Clerk blog post](https://clerk.com/blog/add-onboarding-flow-for-your-application-with-clerk#add-custom-claims-to-your-session-token).
