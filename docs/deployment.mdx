## Authentication

Tracecat supports Enterprise SSO via Clerk.
This requires you to have a Clerk account with the following environment variables set:

```bash
# --- Authentication + Clerk ---
TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH=false
# Fill these in!
CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=<your-clerk-frontend-api-url>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-clerk-secret-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
```

Finally, you will need to add custom claims to your sessions.
[This Clerk blog post explains how.](https://clerk.com/blog/add-onboarding-flow-for-your-application-with-clerk#add-custom-claims-to-your-session-token).
