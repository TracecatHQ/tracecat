description: Deploy Tracecat into your own Cloud
---

Self-hosting Tracecat lets you retain data on your own Cloud infrastructure and network.
Only AWS is currently supported, but we plan to support Azure and GCP in the near future.

## AWS

Tracecat supports deployment to AWS using infrastructure-as-code.
You can find the AWS CDK stack in the `aws` [directory](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/blob/main/aws/stack.py).

Tracecat's AWS deployment includes the following resources:
- 1 VPC
- 2 ECS Fargate Services
- 1 Application Load Balancer
- 1 Elastic File System
- Security groups
- Log groups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create AWS secret">
    Go into AWS secrets manager and create a key-value pair type secret with the following sensitive data:
    ```
    rabbitmq-default-pass = your_rabbitmq_password
    rabbitmq-default-user = your_rabbitmq_user
    db-encryption-key     = your_fernet_key
    db-uri                = your_postgres_uri
    service-key           = ${ openssl rand -hex 32 }
    signing-secret        = ${ openssl rand -hex 32 }
    supabase-jwt-secret   = your_supabase_jwt_secret

    # Optional
    openai-api-key=       = your-openai-api-key
    resend-api-key=       = your-resend-api-key
    ```
    Keep note of the created AWS secret's ARN.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure domains and TLS certificates">
    Use Route53 to create a hosted zone for your domain.
    You will also need to create an ACM certificate for your primary domain
    and subdomains `api.your-domain.com` and `runner.your-domain.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set environment variables">
    Set the following environment variables in the session that you will be deploying Tracecat from.
    These environment variables are used by the AWS CDK stack to configure the deployment.
    ```
    TRACECAT__APP_ENV
    AWS_ECR__REPOSITORY_URI
    AWS_ECR__IMAGE_TAG
    AWS_SECRET__ARN
    AWS_ROUTE53__HOSTED_ZONE_ID
    AWS_ROUTE53__HOSTED_ZONE_NAME
    AWS_ACM__CERTIFICATE_ARN
    AWS_ACM__API_CERTIFICATE_ARN
    AWS_ACM__RUNNER_CERTIFICATE_ARN
    ```
    <Info>You can define `TRACECAT__APP_ENV` as `production`, `staging`, or `development`.</Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone GitHub repository">
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
    cd tracecat
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install AWS CDK dependencies">

    <Info>You'll need to install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this step.</Info>

    ```bash
    npm install -g aws-cdk@2.133 && cdk --version
    pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements-cdk.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy AWS CDK stack">

    First make sure you are [properly authenticated]() with AWS CLI and have the [appropriate permissions]() to deploy AWS CDK stacks.
    Run the following commands to deploy Tracecat to AWS:

    ```bash
    cdk synth --app "python3 aws_cdk_app.py"
    cdk bootstrap --app cdk.out
    cdk deploy --app cdk.out --require-approval never
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
