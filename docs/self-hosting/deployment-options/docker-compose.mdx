title: Docker Compose
description: Deploy Tracecat using a Docker Compose template.
---

<Note>
If you're deploying Tracecat into an external instance (e.g. AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM),
please note that you'll have to set `PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `PUBLIC_API_URL` in the `.env` file
to the IP address or host you are accessing Tracecat from.

For example, if you are port forwarding Tracecat from `http://localhost` (port 80) inside AWS EC2
to `http://localhost:8080` on your local machine, you must set `PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `http://localhost:8080`
and `PUBLIC_API_URL` to `http://localhost:8080/api/`.

You can set these options when running the `env.sh` configuration script.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Verify Prerequisites

To verify that Docker Compose and Docker are installed on the machine where you plan to install Tracecat, run the following commands.

```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker

# Check Docker Compose installation
docker compose
```

## Download Configuration Files

Tracecat requires a set of environment variables and credentials stored in `.env` file to run.
We created a helpful shell script to generate the `.env` file.
Use the commands listed below to download the required configuration files
(`env.sh`, `.env.example`) and generate your own `.env` file.

```bash
curl -o env.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.13.1/env.sh
curl -o .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.13.1/.env.example
chmod +x env.sh && ./env.sh
```

You should see the following instructions after executing `env.sh`.

<Note>
If you're deploying Tracecat into local docker compose, input:
- `y` (yes to production mode)
- `localhost` (default host)
- `n` (no to postgres SSL mode).

If you're deploying Tracecat into an external / Cloud VM, input:
- `y` (yes to production mode)
- `<host-where-tracecat-is-exposed>` (e.g. `localhost:8080`)
- `n` (no to postgres SSL mode).
</Note>

## Download Caddyfile

Tracecat uses Caddy as a reverse proxy.
You'll need to download the following `Caddyfile` to configure this service.

```bash
curl -o Caddyfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.13.1/Caddyfile
```

## Download Docker Compose File

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.13.1/docker-compose.yml
```

## Start Tracecat

Run the command below to start Tracecat and all related services.
Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` and generated `.env` files are in the same directory.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Your Tracecat instance should now be running on `http://localhost`.
To access the Tracecat GUI, visit `http://localhost`.

<Tip>
  Tracecat comes with a REST API, you can visit the live API docs at
  `http://localhost/api/docs`.
</Tip>

## Login

Every new Tracecat deployment is created with a default admin user.
This user owns the organization and has super admin rights to every workspace in the Tracecat deployment.

We highly recommend changing the default email and password immediately after login.
See the following warning callout box for details:

<Warning>
We cannot stress this enough. Don't forget to change the email and password of the default admin user in production!

The login the first time: default email is `admin@domain.com` and the default password is `password`.

</Warning>

## Next Steps

- Log into Tracecat and build your first playbook. [View quickstart](/quickstart).
- Tracecat comes with basic (email + password) authentication. Find out how to configure other authentication methods. [View docs](/self-hosting/authentication/introduction).
- Read inline comments in the generated `.env` file to better understand Tracecat's configurations. [View `.env.example` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.13.1/.env.example)
- (Optional) Configure external-facing webhooks. [View docs](/self-hosting/webhooks).
