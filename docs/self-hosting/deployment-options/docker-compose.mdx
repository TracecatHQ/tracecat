description: Deploy Tracecat using a Docker Compose template.
---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Verify Prerequisites

To verify that Docker Compose and Docker are installed on the machine where you plan to install Tracecat, run the following commands.

```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker

# Check Docker Compose installation
docker compose
```

## Download Configuration Files

Tracecat requires a set of environment variables and credentials stored in `.env` file to run.
We created a helpful shell script to generate the `.env` file.
Use the commands listed below to download the required configuration files
(`env.sh`, `.env.example`) and generate your own `.env` file.

```bash
curl -o env.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.0/env.sh
curl -o .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.0/.env.example
chmod +x env.sh && ./env.sh
```

You should see the following instructions after executing `env.sh`.
Press enter to select the default options.

## Download Docker Compose File

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.0/docker-compose.yml
```

## Start Tracecat

Run the command below to start Tracecat and all related services.
Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` and generated `.env` files are in the same directory.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Your Tracecat instance should now be running on `http://localhost`.
To access the Tracecat GUI, visit `http://localhost`.

## Next Steps

- Log into Tracecat and build your first playbook. [View quickstart](/quickstart).
- Tracecat comes with basic (email + password) authentication. Find out how to configure other authentication methods. [View docs](/self-hosting/authentication/introduction).
- Read inline comments in the generated `.env` file to better understand Tracecat's configurations. [View `.env.example` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.0/.env.example)
- (Optional) Configure external-facing webhooks. [View docs](/self-hosting/webhooks).
