description: Use Terraform to deploy Tracecat onto an EC2 instance.

<Info>
This deployment is isolated to a private network.
Secure access to the EC2 instance is enabled via [Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-with-systems-manager-session-manager.html),
which comes preconfigured with Tracecat's AWS EC2 Terraform stack.
