## Default Admin User

The default admin user owns the organization and has admin rights to every workspace in the Tracecat deployment.

<Note>
  There are two ways the default admin user is created:

  - If basic auth is enabled, the default admin user is created from the email and password provided in the environment variables.
  - If OAuth or SAML SSO is enabled, the default admin user is assigned to the first user that logs into the Tracecat instance.
</Note>

## Authentication Methods

<Warning>
  In production, use [OAuth](/self-hosting/authentication/google) or [SAML SSO](/self-hosting/authentication/okta).
  Basic auth is meant for local development only.
</Warning>

Tracecat currently supports the following authentication methods:

- `basic`: Email and Password
- `google_oauth`: Google OAuth
- `sso`: SAML SSO

Choose from a number of authentication methods listed below to get started.

## Enable / Disable Authentication Methods

You can enable / disable multiple authentication methods in the `.env` file by modifying the `TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES` environment variable.
`TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES` is a comma separated list of auth method keys: i.e. `basic`, `google_oauth`, `sso`.

```bash
TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES=basic,google_oauth,sso
```
