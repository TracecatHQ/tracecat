## Default Admin User

Every new Tracecat deployment is created with a default admin user.
This user owns the organization and has super admin rights to every workspace in the Tracecat deployment.

We highly recommend changing the default email and password immediately after login.
See the following warning callout box for details:

<Warning>
We cannot stress this enough. Don't forget to change the email and password of the default admin user in production!

The default email is `admin@domain.com` and the default password is `password`.

</Warning>

## Enable / Disable Authentication Methods

You can enable / disable multiple authentication methods in the `.env` file by modifying the `TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES` environment variable.
`TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES` is a comma separated list of auth method keys: i.e. `basic`, `google_oauth`.

```bash
TRACECAT__AUTH_TYPES=basic,google_oauth
```
