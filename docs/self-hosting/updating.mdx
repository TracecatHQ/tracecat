title: Updating Tracecat
description: Learn how to safely update versions and run data migrations.

<Note>
Updates and data migrations can be tricky business. We'd love to help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8).
</Note>

<Warning>
If you want to migrate secrets, please make sure to save your database encryption / decryption Fernet key.
You can find this key in your `.env` file assigned to the environment variable: `TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
</Warning>

## Docker Compose

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download latest environment variables migration script and template">
    Fetch the latest environment variables migration script `env-migration.sh`
    and template `.env.example` to ensure compatibility with the new Tracecat version.
    ```
    curl -o env-migration.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.2/env-migration.sh
    curl -o .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.2/.env.example
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute environment variables migration">
    Run the environment variables migration script to update your existing `.env` file with any new or changed variables.
    ```
    chmod +x env-migration.sh && ./env-migration.sh
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Docker Compose Configuration">
    Download the latest Docker Compose file.
    ```
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/0.7.2/docker-compose.yml
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Tracecat">
    Run `docker compose up` using the new Docker Compose and `.env` files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Terraform Deployments

All of Tracecat's Cloud deployments (e.g. AWS EC2, AWS ECS) are configured using Terraform.
To update Tracecat, you can download the latest Terraform stack from Tracecat's GitHub repo and run `terraform apply`.

## Data Migration

As of version 0.7.2, data migrations are automatically applied when the API service is spun up.
Data migrations are, however, non-trivial operations.
We recommend backing up your database before running migrations, especially in a production environment.

<Note>
If the API service fails to spin up due to a data migration error, do not worry!
Your data is still intact. Make sure you first backup the core Tracecat database:

- For Docker Compose and AWS EC2 deployments, this would be the `core-db` volume in Tracecat's Docker stack.
- For AWS ECS Fargate deployments, backups are created automatically as part of the RDS postgres service.

Then contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8) or email [founders@tracecat.com](mailto:founders@tracecat.com) for live migration support.

We're releasing a self-serve guide for manual migration in the coming months.
For the time being, however, we recommend contacting us for one-on-one help!
