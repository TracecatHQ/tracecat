In this guide, we will show you how to run Tracecat locally using Docker Compose.

## Video Tutorial

_Updated video tutorial coming soon!_

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Docker Engine v20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Compose V2: `docker compose`)

You can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to get both Docker Engine and Docker Compose.

If you wish to expose webhooks to the internet, see the section on [exposing webhooks](#expose-webhooks).

To add API credentials for integrations, see [secrets](/concepts/secrets).
You can find the full list of out-of-the-box integrations and their required credentials [here](/integrations).

## Setup Tracecat on localhost

Tracecat can be deployed locally from our Github repository.

Run these commands to clone the Tracecat repository:

```bash
# Clone latest stable release
git clone --branch 0.6.6 --single-branch https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
cd tracecat
```

### Environment variables

We provide a script called `env.sh` that creates a `.env` file with a fresh database encryption key, API service key, and webhook signing secret for you.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Setup script (recommended)
chmod +x env.sh
./env.sh
```
```bash Manual
cp .env.example .env
# You will have to replace the environment variables prefixed with `your-.*` with your own values.
```

</CodeGroup>

| Prefix         | Description                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRACECAT__`   | Tracecat's internal environment variables                                                                      |
| `TEMPORAL__`   | Tracecat's Temporal-specific environment variables. Tracecat uses these to connect to local Temporal services. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_` | NextJS-specific public environment variables                                                                   |
| `NEXT_SERVER_` | NextJS-specific environment variables                                                                          |

<Tip>
  The Temporal setup in the base docker compose file is for local use. For
  production and cloud deployments, we'd love to help you on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8), or if you prefer to [meet with
  us](https://cal.com/team/tracecat/hello)!
</Tip>

### Start Tracecat

Start the Tracecat services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Expose webhooks (optional)

Your webhooks are not exposed to the internet by default.
That said, you can still run workflows directly using the Tracecat CLI or hitting `localhost` endpoints.

If you wish to expose webhooks to the internet, you can use a reverse tunnel like `ngrok` or `bore` to expose your local services to the internet.

Full list of alternative tunneling services [here](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling).

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="bore">
Full instructions [here](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore).

Install `bore` by running:

```bash
brew install bore-cli
```

Then run the following command to route your local port 8000 through bore's public URL:

```bash
bore local 8000 --to bore.pub
```

Update your `.env` file with the public runner URL:

```bash
TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL=https://the-url-you-get-from-bore.pub
```

Finally, restart the docker compose stack to apply the changes.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="ngrok">
Go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account.
Follow the instructions in [getting started](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to install `ngrok` on your local machine.
Then, go to [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) and create a new domain (you get 1 free static domain).
The domain should be in the format `<some-random-phrase>.ngrok-free.app`.

Start `ngrok` by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=${YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}.ngrok-free.app 8000
```

If you don't have a static domain, you can use a free ephemeral domain by running:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8000
```

<Note>
  By binding `ngrok` to port 8000 on the host machine, incoming webhook requests
  are forwarded to the workflow runner.
</Note>

If correctly set up, your .env should contain:

```bash
TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL=https://${YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}.ngrok-free.app
```

Finally, restart the docker compose stack to apply the changes.

<Info>
  In the interest of security, we recommend using a tunneling service only for
  development/testing purposes.

## Access Tracecat

The Tracecat UI should now be running on port `3000`.
To access the UI, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You do not need to create an account for local usage.

Tracecat's API server is also accessible via port `8000`. You should see

```json
{
  "message": "Hello world. I am the API."
}
```

when you navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

You can also visit the Temporal Web UI (port `8080`) at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to monitor the workflows.

<Check>
  Congratulations! You have successfully installed Tracecat. This setup includes
  the essential components to set up a Tracecat proof-of-concept (PoC). For
  production-ready self-hosting solution, we recommend using one of our [Cloud
  deployment](/deployment) strategies.
