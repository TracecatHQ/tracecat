title: External Facing Webhooks
description: Securely expose webhooks to the internet and receive external events.
---

<Note>
Webhooks in the [docker compose](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose) deployment are not exposed to the internet by default.
If you wish to expose your webhooks to the internet, you can use a reverse tunnel like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore).
</Note>

This section is under construction ðŸš§.
We recently made changes to Tracecat's networking setup and have yet to update these docs.

In the meantime, if you need help setting up `ngrok` or `bore`, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8)!
