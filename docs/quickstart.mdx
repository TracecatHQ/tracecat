If you haven't installed Tracecat yet, please check out our [self-hosting docs](/self-hosting/introduction) for step-by-step deployment instructions.
</Warning>

## Introduction

By the end of this quickstart, you will:
- Create a new workflow
- Add a secret credential that allows Tracecat to access the VirusTotal API
- Use integrations to automate a simple threat enrichment playbook,
learn to work with Tracecat's built-in case management system,
and run the workflow live.

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
- VirusTotal API key. You can obtain one for free from the [VirusTotal website](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey).

## Tutorial

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Tracecat">
    <Note>
        If you are working with a brand new Tracecat deployment, you can find the default admin user's email and password in the [authentication docs](/self-hosting/authentication/introduction).

  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    ![Create new workflow](/img/quickstart/create-new-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rename workflow">
    ![Rename workflow](/img/quickstart/change-workflow-name.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add enrichment step">
    From the trigger action, search and select the VirusTotal **Analyze URL** integration.
    ![Add new action](/img/quickstart/add-node.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass URL from webhook into analyze URL action inputs">
    <Tip>
        Tracecat comes with a powerful templating language called "expressions" to manipulate data directly in action inputs.
        You can find out more [here in our docs](/concepts/expressions).
    </Tip>
    Use expressions and [JSONPath match syntax](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base-01.html) to select data from the webhook trigger.

    Fill in inputs with the following:

    ```yaml
    url: ${{ TRIGGER.url_input }}
    ```

    ![Configure VirusTotal URL input](/img/quickstart/configure-vt-input.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add secret">
    Add your VirusTotal API key to workspace secrets.
    For the integration to work, you'll need to name the secret `virustotal` and assign your API token to a `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` secret key.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add open case step">
    Go back to the workflow builder.
    From the analyze URL action, search and select the **Open Case** action.

    Fill in **Inputs** with the following:
    
    ```yaml
    action: informational
    malice: malicious
    status: open
    payload: ${{ ACTIONS.analyze_url.result.data }}
    priority: ${{ 'high' if ACTIONS.analyze_url.result.data.attributes.last_analysis_stats.malicious > 30 else 'medium' }}
    case_title: ${{ TRIGGER.url }}
    ```
    ![Add open case](/img/quickstart/configure-open-case.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add condition to open case">
    To reduce the number of low signal alerts, let's only open a case if there are more than 10 reports of malicious intent.

    Fill in **Run If** under **Control Flow** with the following:
    
    ```yaml
    ${{ ACTIONS.analyze_url.result.data.attributes.last_analysis_stats.malicious > 10 }}
    ```
    ![Add open case](/img/quickstart/configure-open-case.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit (AKA save) workflow">
    ![Save workflow](/img/quickstart/commit-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger workflow">
    You can now trigger the workflow with a JSON payload directly from the UI.
    For this demo, we use the following sample payload:

    ```json
    {"url_input": "crowdstrikebluescreen.com"}
    ```
    ![Trigger workflow](/img/quickstart/trigger-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View workflow context">
    Every workflow run comes with context about every step executed in the workflow.
    You can view this information by switching to the **Runs** tab.
    ![New run context](/img/quickstart/run-context.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View open case">
    ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on running your first security workflow in Tracecat!
    You can finish this quickstart by going into the **Cases** tab to view the newly opened case.
