Tracecat can operate in **headless** (no UI) and **GUI** modes.
The fastest way to get started with Tracecat is to run it locally in headless mode, in which the main interface will be the REST API.

We'll build a simple workflow that does the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive an incoming webhook request">
    We'll send a HTTP request to the webhook with a malicious hash.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload malicious hash to VirusTotal">
    Make a HTTP request to the VirusTotal API to check the hash.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send an email with VirusTotal findings">
    Send an email to yourself with the VirusTotal findings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup

We'll be running Tracecat without authentication for this quickstart.

## Step 1: Install Tracecat

Follow the [installation guide](/installation) to install Tracecat and its dependencies (Temporal + ngrok).

### Prerequisites

- [VirusTotal API key](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/sign-in) (free tier)
- [Resend API key](https://www.resend.com/) (free tier)

### Install Tracecat CLI (optional)

Requires Python 3.12. Run the following command:
```bash
cd tracecat && pip install .
```

## Step 2: Create a new workflow

With Tracecat running, create a new workflow from your terminal:


<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Using curl
  curl -X POST "$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/workflows" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title":"My first workflow"}'
  ```

```bash Using Tracecat CLI
tracecat workflow create --title "My first workflow"
```
</CodeGroup>

Take note of the workflow ID (some `wf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`) returned. We'll refer to this as `$WORKFLOW_ID`.
We recommend exporting this as an environment variable for convenience:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_ID=wf-... # Replace with the actual ID
```

<Note>
  Please replace `$WORKFLOW_ID` with the actual ID in the following steps if you
  choose not to export it.
</Note>

## Step 3: Build the workflow using YAML

Create a file called `playbook.yml` and paste the following contents:

```yaml virustotal_email.yml
title: Send Virustotal report to email
description: |
  Scan a malicious hash on Virustotal and
  send the results to an email address.

inputs:
  # CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
  email_address: hello@world.com

entrypoint: call_virustotal
triggers:
  - type: webhook
    ref: my_webhook
    entrypoint: call_virustotal

actions:
  - ref: call_virustotal
    action: core.http_request
    args:
      url: https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/${{ TRIGGER.hash }}
      method: GET
      headers:
        x-apikey: ${{ SECRETS.virustotal.VT_API_KEY }}

  - ref: send_email_with_virustotal_results
    action: core.send_email
    depends_on:
      - call_virustotal
    args:
      recipients:
        - ${{ INPUTS.email_address }}
      subject: Malware report for ${{ TRIGGER.hash }}
      body: |
        Hello!

        Below is the daily malware report summary for the file.

        1. File Identification

        SHA256: ${{ ACTIONS.call_virustotal.result.data.data.attributes.sha256 }}
        File Names: ${{ FN.join(ACTIONS.call_virustotal.result.data.data.attributes.names) -> str }}

        2. Submission Dates

        First Submission: ${{ ACTIONS.call_virustotal.result.data.data.attributes.first_submission_date }}
        Last Analysis: ${{ ACTIONS.call_virustotal.result.data.data.attributes.last_analysis_date }}

        3. Analysis Results

        Malicious Detections:
        ${{ ACTIONS.call_virustotal.result.data.data.attributes.last_analysis_results }}

        4. Detection Tags

        ${{ FN.join(ACTIONS.call_virustotal.result.data.data.attributes.tags) -> str }}
        5. File Details

        ~Tracecat
```

## Step 4. Create secrets

Create secrets for the VirusTotal and Resend API keys:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using curl
# Replace 'your-virustotal-api-key' with the actual key
curl -X PUT  "$TRACECAT__API_URL/secrets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type":"custom",
    "name":"virustotal",
    "keys":[
      {
        "key":"VT_API_KEY",
        "value": "your-virustotal-api-key"
      }
    ]
  }'

# Replace `your-resend-api-key` with the actual key
curl -X PUT  "$TRACECAT__API_URL/secrets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type":"custom",
    "name":"resend_api_key",
    "keys":[
      {
        "key":"RESEND_API_KEY",
        "value": "your-resend-api-key"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```bash Using Tracecat CLI
tracecat secret create virustotal VT_API_KEY=your-virustotal-api-key
tracecat secret create resend RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Commit workflow changes

We now run the following command to convert the YAML file into a [Workflow Definition](/workflow-definition),
meaning it can now be executed by Tracecat workflow runners.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using curl
curl -X POST "$TRACECAT__API_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/commit" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -F "yaml_file=@/path/to/slack_notifications_for_aws_guardduty.yml"
```

```bash Using Tracecat CLI
tracecat workflow commit --file /path/to/playbook.yml $WORKFLOW_ID
```
</CodeGroup>


## Step 5: Activate workflow and webhook

On creation, workflows and their webhooks are deactivated by default.
You need to enable them before they can be triggered.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using curl
curl -X PATCH  "$TRACECAT__API_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/webhook" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"online"}'

curl -X PATCH  "$TRACECAT__API_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"online"}'
```

```bash Using Tracecat CLI
tracecat workflow up --webhook $WORKFLOW_ID
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 6: Run workflow

First fetch the webhook URL:

```bash Get the webhook URL
curl -X GET "$TRACECAT__API_URL/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/webhook" -H "Authorization: Bearer super-secret-jwt-token"
```

Then send a POST request to the webhook URL. The POST request should contain the hash of the malicious file you want to check.
Check out [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/verify-ua/) for a list of malicious hashes.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using curl
# Replace $WEBHOOK_URL and 'your-malicious-hash' with the actual URL
curl -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hash":"your-malicious-hash"}'
```

```bash Using Tracecat CLI
tracecat workflow run --data '{"hash":"your-malicious-hash"}' $WORKFLOW_ID
```
</CodeGroup>
