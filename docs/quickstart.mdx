  docs](/self-hosting/introduction) for step-by-step deployment instructions.

## Introduction

By the end of this quickstart, you will:

- Create a new workflow
- Add a secret credential that allows Tracecat to access the VirusTotal API
- Use integrations to automate a simple threat enrichment playbook,
  learn to work with Tracecat's built-in case management system,
  and run the workflow live.

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- VirusTotal API key. You can obtain one for free from the [VirusTotal website](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey).

## Tutorial

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Tracecat">
    <Note>
        If you are working with a brand new Tracecat deployment, you can find the default admin user's email and password in the [authentication docs](/self-hosting/authentication/introduction).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    ![Create new workflow](/img/quickstart/create-new-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rename workflow">
      Rename the workflow and save the changes by clicking on the save button.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add enrichment step">
    From the trigger action, search and select the VirusTotal **Search URL with VirusTotal** integration.
    ![Add new action](/img/quickstart/add-node.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass URL from webhook into Search URL action inputs">
    <Tip>
        Tracecat comes with a powerful templating language called "expressions" to manipulate data directly in action inputs.
        You can find out more [here in our docs](/concepts/expressions).
    </Tip>
    Use expressions and [JSONPath match syntax](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base-01.html) to select data from the webhook trigger.

    Fill in inputs with the following:

    ```yaml
    url: ${{ FN.to_base64(TRIGGER.url_input) }}
    ```

    You'll need to Base64 encode the URL input using a the `to_base64` function.

    Make sure to save the action inputs by clicking on the **Save** button at the top right of the action panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add secret">
    Add your VirusTotal API key to workspace secrets.
    For the integration to work, you'll need to name the secret `virustotal` and assign your API token to a `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` secret key.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit (AKA save) workflow">
    This publishes a live version of your workflow.
    ![Save workflow](/img/quickstart/commit-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger workflow">
    You can now trigger the workflow with a JSON payload directly from the UI.
    For this demo, we use the following sample payload:

    ```json
    {"url_input": "https://crowdstrikebluescreen.com"}
    ```
    ![Trigger workflow](/img/quickstart/trigger-workflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View workflow context">
    Every workflow run comes with context about every step executed in the workflow.
    You can view this information by switching to the **Runs** tab.
