## Introduction

By the end of this quickstart, you will:
- Create a new workflow,
- Add a secret credential that allows Tracecat to access the VirusTotal API
- 
use integrations to automate a simple threat enrichment playbook,
learn to work with Tracecat's built-in case management system,
and run the workflow live.

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
- VirusTotal API key. You can obtain one for free from the [VirusTotal website](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey).

    <Tip>
        Tracecat comes with a powerful templating language called "expressions" to manipulate data directly in action inputs.
        You can find out more [here in our docs](/concepts/expressions).

    Use expressions and [JSONPath match syntax](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base-01.html) to select data from the webhook trigger.
