<Note>
  Self deployment can be tricky. We'd love to help on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8)!
</Note>

Install Tracecat locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

### Required

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

### Optional

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- [Resend API Key](https://resend.com/docs/introduction)

## Start Tracecat

Run the command below to start Tracecat and all related services.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
cd tracecat
chmod +x services.sh
bash services.sh start
```

<Note>
You can run `bash services.sh start --tail` to view the logs of all services in real-time.
</Note>

You'll be prompted to enter your public facing Runner URL (you can set one up using ngrok, see below), OpenAI API key, and Resend API key.
If you'd rather provide these later, you can skip each prompt step by pressing `Enter`.
You can update the `.env` file in the root directory then run `bash services.sh start` again to restart the services.

## Expose runner via ngrok

Go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account.
Then follow instructions in [getting started](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to install ngrok on your local machine.
Lastly, go to [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains), create a new domain, and run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=your-ngrok-url-here 8001
```

<Note>
  This forwards the runner server to the internet and enables incoming webhooks.
</Note>

## Create user

Go to the Supabase dashboard at `http://localhost:54323`, navigate to the authentication tab, and create a new user.

## Access Tracecat

The Tracecat frontend should now be running on port `3000`.
To access the frontend, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
Sign-in with the user you created in Supabase.

Tracecat's API and runner servers are also accessible via ports `8000` and `8001`, respectively.
You can view the API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and the runner docs at `http://localhost:8001/docs`.

<Check>
  Congratulations! You have successfully installed Tracecat. This setup includes
  the essential components to set up a Tracecat proof-of-concept (PoC). For
  production-ready self-hosting solution, we recommend using one of our [Cloud deployment](/deployment) strategies.

## Stop Tracecat

To spin down all services, run the following command:

```bash
bash services.sh stop
```

If you'd like to spin down specific services, you can pass additional options as such:

```bash
bash services.sh stop --internal # or -i, Stops all Tracecat internal services
bash services.sh stop --supabase # or -s, Stops Supabase services
```

## Restarting services

Running `bash services.sh start` will restart all services if they are already running.
