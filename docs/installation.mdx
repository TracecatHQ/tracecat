<Note>
  Self deployment can be tricky. We'd love to help on

</Note>

Install Tracecat using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#installing-the-supabase-cli)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack)
- [Resend API Key](https://resend.com/docs/introduction)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## Clone GitHub repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
```

## Start Supabase Postgres Database

You'll need the Docker engine running for this to work. Navigate to the `tracecat` root folder and run

```bash
supabase start
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
❯ supabase start
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
     GraphQL URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/graphql/v1
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
      JWT secret: super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long
        anon key: ey...
service_role key: ey...
```

## Set up environment variables

### Create `.env` file in the tracecat root directory

```bash
# In tracecat/.env
TRACECAT__SIGNING_SECRET=${ openssl rand -hex 32 }
TRACECAT__SERVICE_KEY=${ openssl rand -hex 32 }
TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-fernet-key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-supabase-jwt-secret
# If running locally, this will be
# SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long
SUPABASE_JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"
SUPABASE_PSQL_URL=your-supabase-psql-url
# If running locally this will be
# SUPABASE_PSQL_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres
# NOTE: The port here is the container's port (default '5432') to allow for services in the local docker network to reach the database.
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
TRACECAT__SELF_HOSTED_DB_BACKEND="postgres" # Or "sqlite", but we don't recommend this for now
```

_Note: to generate a `TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` you'll need to create a Fernet key: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/._

### Expose the runner

We need to expose the runner so that we can reach our webhooks from external services. A simple way to do this is to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

We recommend you grab a free static url from their page.

```bash
TRACECAT__RUNNER_URL=https://your-runner-url
```

## Create `.env.local` file in `tracecat/frontend`

Our frontend stack is React + Typescript + NextJS. Add the following:

```bash
# In tracecat/frontend/.env.local
NODE_ENV="development"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV="dev"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_HOSTED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="http://localhost:54321"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= ... # From output of supabase start
```

## Start Tracecat

### Backend

At this point, the Supabase stack should already be running. Run the following to bring up Tracecat `nginx`, `api`, and `runner` services:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.self-host.yaml up
```

Allow incoming webhooks for the runner:

```bash
# Tracecat runner listens on port 8001
ngrok http --domain=your-ngrok-url-here.ngrok-free.app 8001
```

### Frontend

Inside `tracecat/frontend`, install dependencies with

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then run the frontend in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Alternatively if you'd like to build it:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

_Note: We're working on adding the frontend to the docker compose stack!_

## Getting started

You can access Tracecat's frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
and the OpenAPI docs at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

Once the frontend and backend services are running, you should see a email + password login page at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Create a user and log in

To create a user account, visit the Supabase dashboard at [http://localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323) and click on `Authentication` on the left side panel. You should see a dropdown `Add User` at the top right of the page, where you can create a user.
After doing so, you should be able to log into through the frontend.

## Shut down

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.self-host.yaml down --remove-orphans && supabase stop
```
