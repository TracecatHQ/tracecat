<Note>
  Self deployment can be tricky. We'd love to help on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8)!
</Note>

Install Tracecat locally on your machine.

_NOTE: The default setup is not intended for production use, but rather for
development and testing purposes._

## Prerequisites

### Required

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Docker Engine v20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Compose V2)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (with Node v20+)

### Optional

You don't have to set up these services to run Tracecat, but they are required for certain features.

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup) (required for AI actions)
- [Resend API Key](https://resend.com/docs/introduction) (required for Email actions)

## Setup

Please install the prerequisite tools beforehand.

Clone the Tracecat repository and navigate to the project root:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
cd tracecat
```

From here, install the frontend dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

<Note>
  The frontend Docker container looks for `node_modules` on the host machine.
</Note>

### Environment variables

#### Manual

To manually set up environment variables, copy `.env.example` to create a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will have to replace the environment variables prefixed with `your-.*` with your own values.

#### Using `env.sh` (recommended)

The `env.sh` script runs commands to set up the database encryption key, API service key, and webhook signing secret for you.

Run the following command to create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
chmod +x env.sh
bash env.sh
```

You'll be prompted to enter your public facing Runner URL, OpenAI API key, and Resend API key.
If you'd rather provide these later, you can skip each prompt step by pressing `Enter`.

If you use `ngrok`, the Runner URL should take the form `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.ngrok-free.app`.
See the section [Expose runner via ngrok](#expose-runner-via-ngrok) for more details.

### Expose runner via ngrok

Go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account.
Follow the instructions in [getting started](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to install `ngrok` on your local machine.
Then, go to [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) and create a new domain (you get 1 free static domain).
The domain should be in the format `<some-random-phrase>.ngrok-free.app`.

For example, if your ngrok domain is `your-grnok-domain.ngrok-free.app`, start `ngrok` by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=your-ngrok-domain.ngrok-free.app 8001
```

If you don't have a static domain, you can use a free ephermeral domain by running:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8001
```

<Note>
  By binding `ngrok` to port 8001 on the host machine, incoming webhook requests
  are forwarded to the Runner container.
</Note>

If correctly set up, your .env should contain:

```bash
TRACECAT__RUNNER_URL=https://your-ngrok-domain.ngrok-free.app
```

### Linux users

If you are using Linux, you may encounter issues around being unable to resolve `host.docker.internal` from within the Docker containers.

To resolve this, you can add the following parameter to each of the services in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, as suggested by this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67158212).

For example:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    container_name: api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./tracecat:/app/tracecat
      - app-storage:/var/lib/tracecat
    environment:
      API_MODULE: "tracecat.api.app:app"
      # Shared
      LOG_LEVEL: ${LOG_LEVEL}
      RABBITMQ_URI: ${RABBITMQ_URI}
      TRACECAT__APP_ENV: ${TRACECAT__APP_ENV}
      TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY: ${TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
      TRACECAT__DB_URI: ${TRACECAT__DB_URI}
      TRACECAT__SERVICE_KEY: ${TRACECAT__SERVICE_KEY}
      TRACECAT__SIGNING_SECRET: ${TRACECAT__SIGNING_SECRET}
      TRACECAT__API_URL: ${TRACECAT__API_URL}
      TRACECAT__RUNNER_URL: ${TRACECAT__RUNNER_URL}
      # Auth
      CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL: ${CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL}
      TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH: ${TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH}
      # Integrations
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      rabbitmq:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - internal-network
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
# Do the same for the rest of the services
# ...
```

### Start Tracecat services

Finally, start Tracecat using `docker compose`:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Access Tracecat

The Tracecat frontend should now be running on port `3000`.
To access the frontend, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
You do not need to create an account for local usage.

Tracecat's API and runner servers are also accessible via ports `8000` and `8001`, respectively.
You can view the API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and the runner docs at `http://localhost:8001/docs`.

<Check>
  Congratulations! You have successfully installed Tracecat. This setup includes
  the essential components to set up a Tracecat proof-of-concept (PoC). For
  production-ready self-hosting solution, we recommend using one of our [Cloud
  deployment](/deployment) strategies.

## Stop Tracecat

To spin down all services, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

## Authentication

So far, we've shown how to run Tracecat locally without authentication and running with a default user.

If you want to enable authentication, you can set the `TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH` environment variable to `false` or `0` in the `.env` file. This requires you to have a Clerk account and set up the Clerk environment variables in `.env`.

```bash
# --- Authentication + Clerk ---
TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH=0
# Fill these in!
CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
```

## Troubldshooting

### Docker networking

Some users face issues with Docker DNS resolution. What has often resolved their issues is to use `host.docker.internal` in certain places where container services are being referenced.
This allows Docker containers to reference the Docker host machine.

For example, if you have a service `api` running in a container with port mapping `1234:8000` (mapping of port 1234 on the Docker host and 8000 in the container), from inside the Docker network you should be able to reference it using `http://api:8000`.

If you're using Linux, please refer to the [Linux users](#linux-users) section. On MacOS and Windows WSL, you shouldn't have this issue. If you do, please refer to the [Docker networking docs](https://docs.docker.com/network/) or reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8) for help.
