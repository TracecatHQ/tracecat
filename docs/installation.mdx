</Note>

Install Tracecat locally on your machine.

_NOTE: The default setup is not intended for production use, but rather for
testing and development._

## Video Tutorial

_Updated video tutorial coming soon!_

## Prerequisites

Tracecat can operate in **Headless mode** (no frontend, optional CLI) or **GUI mode** (with frontend).

<Warning>
  <>
    Tracecat runs best on MacOS and and Windows WSL (Ubuntu 20.04 + Docker
    Desktop in Windows).
  </>
  <>
    Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) is also supported, but **you may encounter issues with
    Docker DNS resolution in GUI mode. Please see [Docker
    networking](#docker-networking) to troubleshoot.**
  </>
</Warning>

### Required

Core infrastructure for both headless and GUI modes.

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (built-in resolution for `host.docker.internal`)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Docker Engine v20.10+; ships with Docker Desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Compose V2; ships with Docker Desktop)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (recommended for tunneling)
- [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) (clone this into a separate directory)

### Headless mode only

You can operate Tracecat directly through the REST API.

It also has a CLI, though you'll need Python 3.12+ and pip to install it.

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (CLI only)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (CLI only)

### GUI mode only

You'll need this to run the Tracecat frontend.

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (with Node v20+)

### Optional

You don't have to set up these services to run Tracecat, but they are required for certain features.

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup) (required for AI actions)
- [Resend API Key](https://resend.com/docs/introduction) (required for Email actions)

## Setup

Please install the prerequisite tools beforehand.

First, clone the Tracecat repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TracecatHQ/tracecat.git
cd tracecat
```

### GUI mode

To install the frontend dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
# From the Tracecat directory root
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

<Note>
  The frontend Docker container looks for `node_modules` on the host machine.
</Note>

### Headless CLI mode (optional)

To do this we'll have to install the Tracecat CLI. We recommend installing the CLI in a virtual environment with `pip`.

Activate your virtual environment, then install the CLI:

```bash
# With your venv activated
pip install ".[cli]"
```

You can now access the Tracecat CLI by running:

```bash
tracecat  # or 'tracecat --help'
```

<Note>
  If you use `oh-my-zsh`, running just `tracecat` might move you into the
  Tracecat package. To avoid this you can run `tracecat --help` to see the
  available commands. All other commands should work as expected.
</Note>

### Environment variables

#### Manual

To manually set up environment variables, copy `.env.example` to create a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will have to replace the environment variables prefixed with `your-.*` with your own values.

#### Using `env.sh` (recommended)

The `env.sh` script runs commands to set up the database encryption key, API service key, and webhook signing secret for you.

Run the following command to create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
chmod +x env.sh
bash env.sh
```

You'll be prompted to enter your public facing runner URL, optional OpenAI API key, and optional Resend API key.
If you'd rather provide these later, you can skip each prompt step by pressing `Enter`.

If you use `ngrok`, the public runner URL should take the form `https://<your-ngrok-domain>.ngrok-free.app`.
See the section [Expose webhooks via ngrok](#expose-webhooks-via-ngrok) for more details.

### Expose webhooks via ngrok

Go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account.
Follow the instructions in [getting started](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) to install `ngrok` on your local machine.
Then, go to [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains) and create a new domain (you get 1 free static domain).
The domain should be in the format `<some-random-phrase>.ngrok-free.app`.

For example, if your ngrok domain is `your-grnok-domain.ngrok-free.app`, start `ngrok` by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=your-ngrok-domain.ngrok-free.app 8000
```

If you don't have a static domain, you can use a free ephermeral domain by running:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8000
```

<Note>
  By binding `ngrok` to port 8000 on the host machine, incoming webhook requests
  are forwarded to the workflow runner.
</Note>

If correctly set up, your .env should contain:

```bash
TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL=https://your-ngrok-domain.ngrok-free.app
```

### Linux users

If you are using Linux, you may encounter issues around being unable to resolve `host.docker.internal` from within the Docker containers.

To resolve this, you can add the following parameter to each of the services in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, as suggested by this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67158212).

For example:

```yaml
# See the comments (1) and (2) below
services:
  api:
    build: .
    container_name: api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./tracecat:/app/tracecat
      - app-storage:/var/lib/tracecat
    environment:
      API_MODULE: "tracecat.api.app:app"
      LOG_LEVEL: ${LOG_LEVEL}
      TRACECAT__APP_ENV: ${TRACECAT__APP_ENV}
      TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY: ${TRACECAT__DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
      TRACECAT__DB_URI: ${TRACECAT__DB_URI}
      TRACECAT__SERVICE_KEY: ${TRACECAT__SERVICE_KEY}
      TRACECAT__SIGNING_SECRET: ${TRACECAT__SIGNING_SECRET}
      TRACECAT__API_URL: ${TRACECAT__API_URL}
      TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL: ${TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL}
      # Auth
      CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL: ${CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL}
      TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH: ${TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - tracecat-network
    ###### (1) Add this section here ######
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    #######################################
# (2) Repeat this change for ALL of the services
# ...
```

### Setup Temporal

Visit [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) and follow their installation guide to clone this into a separate directory.
We will just use the base `docker-compose.yml` for this.

## Start Tracecat

The Tracecat stack manages services that span the application and persistence layers.
Temporal manages the workflow orchestration layer.

First, spin up the Temporal stack in the background. From the cloned `temporalio/docker-compose` repository run:

```bash
# In path/to/some/docker-compose
docker compose up -d
```

Finally, start Tracecat. Navigate to the `tracecat` root directory and run:

<CodeGroup>
# In path/to/tracecat

```bash Headless mode
docker compose up api postgres_db worker
```

```bash GUI mode
docker compose up
```

</CodeGroup>

## Access Tracecat

The Tracecat frontend should now be running on port `3000`.
To access the frontend, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You do not need to create an account for local usage.

Tracecat's API server is also accessible via port `8000`. You should see

```json
{
  "message": "Hello world. I am the API."
}
```

when you navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

You can also visit the Temporal Web UI (port `8080`) at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to monitor the workflows.

<Check>
  Congratulations! You have successfully installed Tracecat. This setup includes
  the essential components to set up a Tracecat proof-of-concept (PoC). For
  production-ready self-hosting solution, we recommend using one of our [Cloud
  deployment](/deployment) strategies.
</Check>

## Stop Tracecat

To spin down all services, in both the cloned `temporalio/docker-compose` and `tracecat` root directories run the following command:

```bash
# Separately in both /path/to/some/docker-compose and /path/to/tracecat
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

## Authentication

So far, we've shown how to run Tracecat locally without authentication and running with a default user.

If you want to enable authentication, you can set the `TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH` environment variable to `false` or `0` in the `.env` file. This requires you to have a Clerk account and set up the Clerk environment variables in `.env`.

```bash
# --- Authentication + Clerk ---
TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH=0
# Fill these in!
CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
```

Finally, you will need to add custom claims to your sessions - follow the steps in [this Clerk blog post](https://clerk.com/blog/add-onboarding-flow-for-your-application-with-clerk#add-custom-claims-to-your-session-token).

## Troubleshooting

### Docker networking

Some users face issues with Docker DNS resolution. What has often resolved their issues is to use `host.docker.internal` in certain places where container services are being referenced.
This allows Docker containers to reference the Docker host machine.

For example, if you have a service `api` running in a container with port mapping `1234:8000` (mapping of port 1234 on the Docker host and 8000 in the container), from inside the Docker network you should be able to reference it using `http://api:8000`.

If you're using Linux, please refer to the [Linux users](#linux-users) section. On MacOS and Windows WSL, you shouldn't have this issue. If you do, please refer to the [Docker networking docs](https://docs.docker.com/network/) or reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8) for help.
