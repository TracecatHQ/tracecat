  Tracecat uses YAML to define inputs and configurations for actions and workflows.

This cheatsheet covers the basics of YAML.
It also covers some common gotchas (e.g. multi-line text, special characters) and how to deal with them.

## Basic Syntax

```yaml
# Key-value pairs
key: value
nested:
  key: value

# Lists
items:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3

# YAML also supports inline JSON and lists
key: {"key": "value"}
key: [item1, item2, item3]

# Strings and numbers
integer: 42
float: 3.14
string: "42"

# Boolean values
enabled: true
disabled: false

# Null value
empty: null
```

## Block Modifiers

<Tip>
  The best way to deal with long configurations and special characters in YAML is to use the block scalars `>-` and `>`.
</Tip>

```yaml
# Literal Block Scalar (|): Preserves all newlines
description: |
  This is a multi-line description.
  Each line break is preserved exactly as written.
  Indentation is respected.

# |- : Strip all trailing newlines
notes: |-
  This text will have
  all trailing newlines removed.

# Folded Block Scalar (>): Converts newlines to spaces
description: >
  This is a multi-line description.
  Line breaks become spaces.

  Blank lines start new paragraphs.

# >- : Folded style with trailing newlines removed
description: >-
  This is a long description
  that spans multiple lines
  but will be rendered as a single line
  with trailing newlines removed.
```
