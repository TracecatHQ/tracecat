description: A cheatsheet for YAML basic syntax, block modifiers, and special characters.

Tracecat uses YAML to define action inputs and workflow configurations.
This cheatsheet covers the basic YAML syntax, block modifiers to handle multi-line text, and special characters.

## Basic Syntax

```yaml
# Key-value pairs
key: value
nested:
  key: value

# Lists
items:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3

# YAML also supports inline JSON and lists
key: {"key": "value"}
key: [item1, item2, item3]

# Strings and numbers
integer: 42
float: 3.14
string: "42"

# Boolean values
enabled: true
disabled: false

# Null value
empty: null
```

## Special Characters

YAML supports escaping characters using backslashes:

```yaml
key: "This is a \"string\" with a quote"
```

## Block Modifiers

<Tip>
  The best way to deal with multi-line configurations and
  special characters in YAML is to use the block scalars `>-` and `>`.
</Tip>

```yaml
# Literal Block Scalar (|): Preserves all newlines
description: |
  This is a multi-line description.
  Each line break is preserved exactly as written.
  Indentation is respected.

# |- : Strip all trailing newlines
notes: |-
  This text will have
  all trailing newlines removed.

# Folded Block Scalar (>): Converts newlines to spaces
description: >
  This is a multi-line description.
  Line breaks become spaces.

  Blank lines start new paragraphs.

# >- : Folded style with trailing newlines removed
description: >-
  This is a long description
  that spans multiple lines
  but will be rendered as a single line
  with trailing newlines removed.
```
