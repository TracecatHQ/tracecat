<Note>
  If you've deployed Tracecat into an external VM (e.g. AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM),
  you'll need to set `PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `PUBLIC_API_URL` in the `.env` file to the IP address or host you are accessing Tracecat from.

  For example, if you are port forwarding Tracecat from `http://localhost` (port 80) inside AWS EC2 to `http://localhost:8080` on your local machine,
  you must set `PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `http://localhost:8080` and `PUBLIC_API_URL` to `http://localhost:8080/api/`.

  Moreover, if you are using a Windows machine, make sure to set the IP address to `127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`).

  You can set these options when running the `env.sh` configuration script.
