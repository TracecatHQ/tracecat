<Note>
  Tracecat uses YAML to define inputs and configurations for actions and workflows.
  YAML is a human-readable configuration language that is easy to write and read.
  It is also more concise than JSON and more customizable than HTML forms.

  If you're new to YAML, you can learn more [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html).
  YAML is also widely used in DevOps tools like Ansible, GitHub Actions, and Docker Compose.
