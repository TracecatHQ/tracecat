  Tracecat uses YAML to define inputs and configurations for actions and workflows.
  YAML is a human-readable configuration language that is easy to write and read.
  It is also more concise than JSON and more customizable than HTML forms.

  If you're new to YAML or need a refresher, check out our [YAML syntax cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/yaml).
  YAML is also widely used in DevOps tools like Ansible, GitHub Actions, and Docker Compose.
