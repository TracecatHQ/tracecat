<Note>
  Tracecat uses [JSONPath](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng?tab=readme-ov-file#jsonpath-syntax)
  and dot notation to select outputs from previous actions.
  JSONPath can also be used to filter and transform nested JSONs.

  Both `ACTIONS` and `TRIGGER` [expression contexts](/quickstart/expressions) support JSONPath syntax.

  If you are new to JSONPath or need a refresher, check out our [JSONPath syntax cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/jsonpath).
