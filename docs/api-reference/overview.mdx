<Note>
    Tracecat API is currently in beta.
</Note>

The REST API provides programmatic access to Tracecat data and functionality.
Run and manage workflows, create and manage secrets, all via the API.

## Case relations and merges

The cases API now exposes dedicated endpoints for managing relational workflows:

- `POST /cases/{case_id}/similar` and `DELETE /cases/{case_id}/similar/{related_case_id}` to annotate two records as similar.
- `POST /cases/{case_id}/merge` and `DELETE /cases/{case_id}/merge/{merged_case_id}` to fold duplicate investigations into a single primary.

Merged cases inherit their primary's lifecycle. By default, listing endpoints hide merged secondariesâ€”pass the `include_merged=true` query parameter to surface them when required.
