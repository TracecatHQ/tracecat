Workflows are a series of steps called [Actions](/core/actions).
Think of a workflow as a recipe that runs each step needed to complete a task, from start to finish.

## Build a workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add starting action">
    Drag and drop an action block from the sidebar onto the workflow canvas.
    Most workflows start with a [Webhook Action](/core/actions#action-types).
    Webhooks allow you to receive data from external systems (e.g. Crowdstrike alerts).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add receiving action">
    Add another action onto the workflow canvas.
    This action could be a [AI Summarize Action](/core/actions#action-types),
    which uses a large language model (LLM) to summarize the alert received in the previous action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect actions">
    <Tip>You can quickly add and connect actions by clicking, instead of dragging, action blocks.</Tip>

    Connect the actions together.
    This creates a sequence of actions that run in order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="⚒️ Configure actions">
    Click on an action in the workflow canvas.
    The right panel will now show the action's configuration options.

    Check out the docs on [Actions](/core/actions) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="🪝 Call the webhook to run your workflow">
    Go to the `Send Payload` control in the bottom right panel.
    You might need to click the workflow canvas for the workflow to be in focus.

    Select a webhook action from the dropdown, input a JSON object to send to that webhook, and click `Send`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="🎉 View workflow run status">
    You can view the status of the workflow run under `Past Runs` in the bottom right panel.

## What next?

### Deploy

You can deploy your workflow using the `Publish` button in the top right corner of the workflow view.

<Info>Deployed workflows runs automatically whenever a starting [Webhook action](/core/actions#action-types) receives new data.</Info>

### Schedule

You can schedule your workflow to run as a cron job.

### Build bigger

You can build more complex workflows with conditional logic, data transforms, AI task workers and more.
See all available [Actions](/core/actions).
