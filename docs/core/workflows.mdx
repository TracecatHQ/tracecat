Workflows are a series of steps called [Actions](/core/actions).
Think of a workflow as a recipe that runs each step needed to complete a task, from start to finish.

## Build a workflow
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add starting action">
    Drag and drop Action blocks from the sidebar into the workflow canvas.
    Most workflows start with a [Webhook action](/core/actions/webhook).
    Webhooks allow you to receive data from external systems (e.g. Crowdstrike alerts).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add next action">
    Click or drag another Action block into the workflow canvas.
    This action could be a [AI summarize action](/core/actions/http-request),
    which uses a large language model (LLM) to summarize the alert received in the previous action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect actions">
    Connect the actions together.
    This creates a sequence of actions that run in order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="ðŸŽ‰ Run your workflow">
    Press the `run` button to execute your workflow.

    To view the results of each action, check out the [event logs](/core/events) search panel.
    Event logs contain the results of each action alongside additional metadata (e.g. published time).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What next?

### Deploy

You can deploy your workflow.

A deployed workflow runs automatically whenever a starting [Webhook action](/core/actions/webhook) receives new data.

### Schedule

You can schedule your workflow to run as a cron job.

### Build bigger

You can build more complex workflows with [conditional logic](/core/conditions),
[AI tasks](/core/ai), [data transforms](/core/transforms) and more.
See all available [Actions](/actions).
