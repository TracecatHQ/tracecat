_Work-in-progress: we plan to release an integrations library end of April 2024._

## Framework

Integrations are actions that execute custom code to interact with external services.
We've developed a simple framework that takes Python functions and converts them into UI action blocks that can be accessed through the 'Integrations' side panel tab.
Each integration is defined as a synchronous function that is registered by the integration registry, for example:

```python
# In tracecat/integrations/example.py

from tracecat.integrations._registry import registry

@registry.register(description="This is a sample integration")
def sample_integration(input1: str, input2: int) -> dict:
    return {"output": f"Hello {input1}, {input2}"}
```

The above would register a new integration called `example.sample_integration`.
When the backend spins up, all integrations are registered with a `registry` singleton.
At runtime, these functions are executed in a process pool to avoid blocking the workflow event loop.

See [create a new integration](#create-a-new-integration) for more details.

The `register` decorator also accepts arbitrary keyword arguments that are stored in the registry.
We plan on using this to further extend the capabilities of integrations, for example by using a `version` keyword argument to specify the version of the integration.

## Secrets

To use credentials for external services, you can declare a list of secret names in the `register` decorator.
You will also have to create these secrets in the platform through the `settings/credentials` UI.
At runtime, only the declared secrets are loaded into the executing process before the function is invoked.

For example, given `my_secret` with key `MY_SECRET_KEY`:

```python
# In tracecat/integrations/example.py

import os
import httpx
from tracecat.integrations._registry import registry

@registry.register(
  description="This is a sample integration with secrets",
  secrets=["my_secret"] # Accepts more than one secret name
)
def requires_api_key(resource_name: str, value: int) -> str:
    # Call this normally like regular Python code!
    api_key = os.environ["MY_SECRET_KEY"]

    with httpx.Client() as client:
        response = client.post(
          f"https://api.example.com/resource/{resource_name}",
          headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
          json={"value": value}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text
```

## Create a new integration

1. [Optional] Create a new integration platform/namespace and add a new platform icon in `frontend/src/components/icons.tsx`
2. Create a new integration function in an integration namespace.
3. Import the `registry` singleton from `tracecat/integrations/_registry.py` and register the integration function using the decorator `@registry.register(...)`.
4. [IMPORTANT] Import the integration nodule into the scope of `integrations/__init__.py`. This eagerly registers all integrations in this module with the registry.
5. Update `ActionType` in types/actions.py
6. (Frontend) Update `integrationTypes` and `integrationPlatforms` in `frontend/src/types/schemas.ts`

Once this is done, the integration should be available in the frontend and backend and can be used like any other action node.

## Input Types

We explicitly don't support highly complex input types. This includes complex union types and heavily nested types, for example `list[str] | str | int | None` would be unsupported.
We also don't support generics and type variables. All types must be concrete. We use Python 3.10+ syntax for type annotations.

Let `T`, `K`, and `V` be a supported builtin types. We have well-defined support for the following data types, for example:

- Builtins: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- Optional: `T | None`
- Defaults: `T | None = None`, `str = "default"`
- Literals: `Literal["a", "b"]` (imported from typing.Literal. Use this for enums)
- List: `list[T]`
- Dict: `dict[K, V]`

This should cover most use cases for integration API endpoints.

## Glossary

- Integration key/qualname: A fully qualified, unique idenfitier for an integration function. The schema is `integrations.<platform>.[<optional_namespaces>.]<fn_name>`.
  - For example:
    - `integrations.github.get_repo`
    - `integrations.github.actions.get_workflow_run`.
