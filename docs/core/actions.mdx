Actions are individual tasks performed at each step of a workflow.
You can find all available Actions in the workspace sidebar.

There are only ten Action types, but they can be configured to perform almost any task.
For example, a [HTTP request](#action-types) can be configured to send a GET request to an API endpoint.
See [Quickstart](/quickstart) for a worked example.

<Info>
We refer to an action that has received an input and produced an corresponding output as an "action run".
</Info>

## Build an Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add action">
    Click or drag-and-drop an action block onto the workflow canvas.

    ![Drag and drop action](/img/dnd.gif)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure action">
    Select your action onto the canvas to open its configuration panel.
    Update the action name, description, and inputs here.
    Press `save`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting Actions

When you link action blocks together, the output of previous actions are passed on to next actions.

<Note>
Outputs from previous actions don't auto-fill inputs for the next action.
You need to do this manually.
Find out how in the next section.
</Note>

### Using Action Outputs as Inputs

Every action has an output. Outputs are JSON objects stored as [Event Logs](/core/event-logs).
You can use the output of one action as the input of another action.

The data within event logs are accessed using JSONPaths.

Check out [using JSONPaths with event logs](/core/event-logs#select-data-in-events) to learn more.
Don't worry if this is new to you! It's designed to be a simple extension of JSON.

### Worked Example

Let's use the three-step workflow from [Connecting Actions](#connecting-actions) as an example.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pass malware sample to webhook">
    Let's assume the [Webhook](#action-types) action (titled "Receive malware sample")
    has the following URL: `https://runner.tracecat-engine.com/webhook/<path>/<secret>`.
    This URL will differ for every user and action block.

    You can pass data into the webhook using cURL.
    In the following example, we send the webhook a SHA-256 malware sample:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"malware_sha256": "78dc6e1d4fbb80814f5c6d7a7da57aaac32a50a97b9963461ff0a19834246d94"}' \
      https://runner.tracecat-engine.com/webhook/<path>/<secret>
    ```

    Tracecat receives the data and stores it as an [event log](/core/event-logs), which looks like this:
    ```json
    {
      "receive_malware_sample": {
        "payload": {
          "malware_sha256": "78dc6e1d4fbb80814f5c6d7a7da57aaac32a50a97b9963461ff0a19834246d94"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    <Note>
    Every event log is a nested JSON that contains the output of every connected action.

    The output of different actions are stored under a unique key.
    Keys are automatically generated from the action title.
    Keys are always lower snakecase.

    For example, an action with the title `Receive URL` will have the key `receive_url`.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get malware report">
    Let's send the malware sample to [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/) for a report.
    Select the [HTTP Request](#action-types) action (titled "Get malware report").

    1. Fill in the action's `url` input field with the following:
    `https://mb-api.abuse.ch/api/v1/query=get_info&hash={{ $.receive_malware_sample.payload.malware_sha256 }}`
    2. Set the `method` input field to `POST`.
    3. Save the action.

    Your configuration form should look like this:

    <Note>
    `{{ $.receive_malware_sample.payload.malware_sha256 }}`
    is the JSONPath query to get the malware sample from the previous action's output.
    </Note>

    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send malware report to yourself">
    Select the [Send Email](#action-types) action (titled "Send malware report").

    1. Fill in the action's `receivers` input field with your email address.
    2. Set the `subject` input field to `Malware report for {{ $.receive_malware_sample.payload.malware_sha256 }}`.
    3. Set the `content` input field to `{{ $.get_malware_report.payload }}`.
    4. Save the action.

    Your configuration form should look like this:

    <Note>

## How about pre-built Actions?

*Work-in-progress: we plan to release pre-built actions end of April 2024.*

Actions can be configured to do almost any tasks, but it's best to use pre-built ones if available.
Pre-built actions have pre-configured inputs to perform tasks for commonly used products.

Here are a few examples:
- `URLScan` Perform a security scan on a given URL
- `VirusTotal` Get detailed report for a malware sample
- `Microsoft Defender` Trigger a scan on a specific file
- `EmailRep` Retrieve reputation information for a given email address
- `GeoIP Lookup` Get the geographical location information for a given IP address.
- `Slack` Send a message to a specific channel on Slack

<Note>
Can't find a pre-built action for a specific product?

Just let us know in the `#feedback` channel in [Tracecat Discord](https://discord.gg/n3GF4qxFU8):
1. What task you want to achieve
2. What product you want to integrate

We respond to every suggestion!
