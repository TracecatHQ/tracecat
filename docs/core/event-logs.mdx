title: Event Logs
description: Outputs from action runs
---

Event logs represent a chain of outputs from action runs.

## Action outputs vs event logs

Let's assume you have simple workflow with actions `Hello A` -> `Hello B` -> `Hello C`.
Let's now assume that action C is a HTTP request action that outputs:
```json
{
  "payload": {
    "text": "I'm the letter C."
  }
}
```
Tracecat refers to this as the "action output" of action C.

The "event log" for action A looks different.
It includes the action output from every connected action that ran before it.
```json
{
  "hello_a": {
    "payload": {
      "text": "I'm the letter A."
    }
  },
  "hello_b": {
    "payload": {
      "text": "I'm the letter B."
    }
  },
  "hello_c": {
    "payload": {
      "text": "I'm the letter C."
    }
  }
}
```

## Event logs = contextualization

Why are event logs useful? In any security incident, contextualization is key.

## Select data in events

Tracecat uses [JSONPath](https://jsonpath.com/) to access data from action outputs.
For example, given the following event log from a configured HTTP request action:
```json
{
  // Previous action outputs above...
  "receive_suspicious_login": {
    "payload": {
        "malware_sha256": "78dc6e1d4fbb80814f5c6d7a7da57aaac32a50a97b9963461ff0a19834246d94"
    }
  }
}
```

to access the `malware_sha256` field from the following output from the `Receive malware sample` action,
you can use the following JSONPath:

```
$.receive.payload.malware_sha256
```
