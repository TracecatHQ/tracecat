description: AI-assisted incident tracking and management

Tracecat's case management system is designed to help you track and manage security incidents.
It's design is inspired by [Rapid7's SMAC (status, malice, action, context)](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/02/12/talkin-smac-alert-labeling-and-why-it-matters/) methodology
and the [alert management system at Brex](https://medium.com/brexeng/elevating-security-alert-management-using-automation-828004ad596c).

## Open case

Use the [Open Case Action](/core/actions#action-types) in a workflow to open a new case.

## View cases

Go to the `Cases` tab to view all cases.
Cases are displayed in a table with the following columns:

<Card title="Payload" icon="lightbulb">
  A JSON object containing information about the case.
</Card>

<Card title="Status" icon="circle-check">
  Is the case `open`, `closed`, `reported`, `escalated`, or `resolved`?
</Card>

<Card title="Malice" icon="user-secret">
  Is the case payload indicative of malicious activity?
  There are only two options avaiable: `malicious` or `benign`.
</Card>

<Card title="Action" icon="bolt">
  What steps can I take to move towards closing or resolving this case?
</Card>

<Card title="Context" icon="tag">
  Context represents information not already captured in the case payload.
</Card>


## Best Practices

<Tip>
To keep incident response repeatable, we recommend expressing case actions as a list of tags.

For example, given a newly opened phishing email case, you might want want to set the tags: "quarantine" and "user-education".

Check out the [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) matrix for ideas.
</Tip>

<Note>
Tracecat automatically fills the case context with the following [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) labels (if applicable).

For example:
```json
{
  "tactic": "initial-access",
  "technique": "phishing",
  "procedure": "email-attachment",
  "threat_group": "0ktapus",
}
```

You can disable this AI feature in `settings`.
