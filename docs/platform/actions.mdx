<Tip>
    Check out the [Actions Registry](/tutorials/3-actions-registry) tutorial for a hands-on guide.
</Tip>

Actions are steps in your workflows.
Connect them together to create automations.
Outputs from upstream actions can be referenced as inputs for downstream actions.

## Success / Error Paths

## Action Results

<Note>
    Actions results are referenced using [JSONPath](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base-01.html) syntax.
</Note>

To retrieve the output from an action, use the following expression syntax:

```yaml
ACTIONS.<action_reference>.result.<jsonpath-to-field>
```

The action reference is a sluggified version of the action's name.
You can quickly copy the reference for an action by clicking the <Icon icon="copy" iconType="solid" /> icon next to the action's name in the node:

![Copy Action Reference](/img/platform/copy-action-reference.png)

## Action Types

There are two types of actions:

- **User-Defined Function (UDF)**: A Python function turned into a referencable action.
- **Action Template**: A YAML template of referencable actions (UDFs and other action templates). These can also be cloned and edited to create new actions.

### Action Templates

Action templates are YAML configuration-as-code templates similar to GitHub Actions workflows.
We recommend using **Action Templates** over Python UDFs whenever possible.

    - Templates are easier to maintain and update across workflows
    - Templates, unlike UDFs, can be cloned and editted directly in the UI.

For example, the action template for the **Search URL with VirusTotal** integration is as follows:

```yaml
type: action
definition:
  title: Search URL with VirusTotal
  description: Get threat intel report for a URL from VirusTotal.
  display_group: VirusTotal
  namespace: integrations.virustotal
  name: search_url
  secrets:
    - name: virustotal
      keys: ["VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"]
  expects:
    url:
      type: str
      description: The URL to search
  steps:
    - ref: search_url
      action: core.http_request
      args:
        url: https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/urls/${{ FN.to_base64(inputs.url) }}
        method: GET
        headers:
          x-apikey: ${{ SECRETS.virustotal.VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY }}
  returns: ${{ steps.search_url.result }}
```

We open sourced action templates for every pre-built integration.
Check them out in Tracecat's public repository [here](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates).

### User-Defined Functions

User-defined functions (UDFs) are Python functions that are automatically converted into no-code actions.
Find out how to create your own UDFs in the [Custom Integrations](/tutorials/6-custom-integrations) tutorial.

## Integrations

Tracecat comes with pre-built integrations for many popular security tools.
A list of supported tools can be found in the [integrations cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/integrations).

<Note>
    Integrations are not automatically updated when you update the Tracecat version.
    You will need to manually sync the Tracecat registry repository from the **Action Registry** page.
