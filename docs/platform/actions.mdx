Actions are steps in your workflows.

<Tip>
    Check out the [Actions Registry tutorial](/tutorials/actions-registry) for a hands-on guide on actions.

## Action Types

There are two types of actions:

- **User-Defined Function (UDF)**: A Python function turned into a referencable action.
- **Action Template**: A YAML template of referencable actions (UDFs and other action templates) that can be used to create new actions.

## Action Templates

<Tip>
    We recommend using Action Templates whenever possible.
    Action templates are easier to maintain and update across workflows compared to UDFs.
    Templates, unlike UDFs, can be cloned and editted directly in the UI.
</Tip>

Action templates are YAML configuration-as-code templates similar to GitHub Actions workflows.

You can find examples of action templates in the [Tracecat GitHub repo](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/registry/tracecat_registry/templates).

## User-Defined Functions

User-defined functions (UDFs) are Python functions that can be referenced in expressions.

Tracecat comes with six core UDF-based actions:
