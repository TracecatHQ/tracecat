title: Expressions
description: Reference action results and workflow metadata in your workflows
---

Expressions are a way to reference data in your workflows.
To use an expression, you must wrap an [expression context](/platform/expressions#expression-contexts) around `${{...}}`.
For example, `${{ ACTIONS.my_action.result }}` will return the result of the `my_action` action.

Expressions are evaluated into a value when the workflow is run.

## Expression Types

Tracecat comes with five expression types:

- `ACTIONS`: Reference the result of an action
- `SECRETS`: Reference secrets
- `TRIGGER`: Reference data passed into the workflow from the webhook
- `INPUTS`: Static workflow inputs
- `FN`: Reference functions (e.g. `FN.contains("a", ["a", "b", "c"])`)
