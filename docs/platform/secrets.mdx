description: Store and retrieve sensitive data
---

Tracecat comes with a build-in secrets manager.
This allows you to store and retrieve sensitive data without exposing the value in plaintext.
Secrets are encrypted at rest and stored in the database.

## Storing secrets

Secrets are scoped to a workspace. To add a secret, navigate to the **Credentials** page and click on the **Create Secret** button.

## Retrieving secrets in workflows

To get a secret and use it in an action input, use the `SECRETS.<secret-name>.<secret-key>` syntax.

Tracecat will automatically replace the expression with the secret value at runtime.
Retrieved secrets are deleted from memory after the workflow run completes.

## Integrations and secrets

<Tip>
    Check out the [Integrations](/platform/integrations) page for a list of pre-built integrations and their required secrets.
</Tip>

Pre-built integrations require a specific secret name and required keys.
For example, the VirusTotal integration requires a secret with the name `virustotal` and the key `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`.

Different integrations may require different required and optional keys.
For example, Tracecat's AWS integration is configured with the following secret with optional keys:

```python
aws_secret = RegistrySecret(
    name="aws",
    optional_keys=[
        # Access key-based authentication
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
        "AWS_REGION",
        # Role-based authentication
        "AWS_ROLE_ARN",
        "AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME",
        # Profile-based authentication
        "AWS_PROFILE_NAME",
    ]
)
```

Check out the [Quickstart](/tutorials/1-quickstart) tutorial for a step-by-step example of the concepts discussed above.

## Organization-level secrets

Tracecat also supports organization-level secrets that are accessible to all workspaces within an organization.
To create an organization-level secret, navigate to the **Organization** page and click on the **Create Secret** button.

## Multi-tenant secrets

A common use case is to have different sets of the same secret for different tenants or environments.
For example, an MDR provider will likely have different Crowdstrike tenant IDs for each customer.

Use Tracecat's secrets manager and child workflows to create and retrieve multi-tenant secrets.

## Example: Multi-account AWS integration

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a multi-tenant secret">
        Create a multi-tenant secret for an integration by specifying the environment key.
        The secret name and keys (e.g. `aws` and `AWS_ROLE_ARN`) remain the same.

        If no environment key is specified, the environment key defaults to `default`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trigger environment-specific child workflow">
        Let's assume you have a child workflow that retrieves GuardDuty detector IDs for a specific AWS account.
        You have multiple sets of `AWS_ROLE_ARN`, one for each account:

        `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/ListGuardDutyDetectors`

        Given a list of AWS account IDs configured in the parent workflow's static inputs,
        select the `Execute Child Workflow` action and configure it with the following inputs:

        ```yaml
        trigger_inputs: <child-workflow-inputs>
        workflow_id: <child-workflow-id>  # You can find this in the workflows table
        environment: <aws-account-id>  # The secret environment
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
