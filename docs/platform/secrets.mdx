Tracecat comes with a build-in secrets manager.
This allows you to store and retrieve sensitive data without exposing the value in plaintext.
Secrets are encrypted at rest and stored in the database.

## Storing secrets

Secrets are scoped to a workspace. To add a secret, navigate to the **Credentials** page and click on the **Create Secret** button.

## Retrieving secrets in workflows

To get a secret and use it in an action input, use the `SECRETS.<secret-name>.<secret-key>` syntax.

Tracecat will automatically replace the expression with the secret value at runtime.
Retrieved secrets are deleted from memory after the workflow run completes.

## Integrations and secrets

<Tip>
    Check out the [Integrations](/platform/integrations) page for a list of pre-built integrations and their required secrets.
</Tip>

Pre-built integrations come configured with a specific secret name and required keys.
For example, the VirusTotal integration requires a secret with the name `virustotal` and the key `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`.

Learn how to configure secrets for pre-built integrations in the [Quickstart](/tutorials/1-quickstart) tutorial.

## Organization-level secrets

Tracecat also supports organization-level secrets that are accessible to all workspaces within an organization.
To create an organization-level secret, navigate to the **Organization** page and click on the **Create Secret** button.
