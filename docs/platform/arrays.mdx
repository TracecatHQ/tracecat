title: Arrays, loops, and filters
description: Learn how to work with lists of items in your workflows.
---

You are likely to encounter lists of items (e.g. alerts, devices, etc.) in your workflows.
This guide will show you five ways you might work with arrays in your workflows:

- [JSONPath filters](/platform/arrays#jsonpath-filters)
- [Action loops](/platform/arrays#action-loops)
- [Filter and loop](/platform/arrays#filter-and-loop)
- [Child workflow loops](/platform/arrays#child-workflow-loops)
- [Inline functions](/platform/arrays#inline-functions)

<Note title="Workflows as functions">
    We recommend using `Action loops` as sparingly as possible.
    Use child workflows instead to better encapsulate operations on each item in an array.

    For example, in an alert enrichment workflow, you should create two workflows:
    - `Receive alerts`: that receives a list of alerts
    - `Enrich alert`: that enriches a **single alert**

    You can then use **Enrich alert** as a child workflow in **Receive alerts** to enrich each alert individually.
    Check out the [child workflow loops](/platform/arrays#child-workflow-loops) section for more information.

## JSONPath filters

JSONPath allows you to perform advanced filtering on arrays of JSON objects.

Tracecat currently supports the following [JSONPath](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng?tab=readme-ov-file#extensions) operators:

- Equality operators: `==`, `=`, `!=`
- Comparison operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- Regex match operator: `=~`

You can combine multiple criteria using the `&` operator.
Properties can only be compared to static values.

Here are some examples of valid filters:

```yaml
# Filter objects where the risk score is greater than 5
${{ ACTIONS.list_alerts.result[?(@.risk_score > 5)] }}

# Filter objects where the severity equals "High"
${{ ACTIONS.list_alerts.result[?(@.severity == "High")] }}

# Filter objects where the `ip_address` field starts with `192.168.1`
${{ ACTIONS.list_alerts.result[?(@.ip_address =~ "192\.168\.1\..*")] }}

# Filter objects with multiple conditions
${{ ACTIONS.list_alerts.result[?(@.risk_score > 5 & @.severity == "High")] }}
```

<Tip>
    A common use case is to filter data before it is passed to another action.
    To do this, use the `Reshape` action along with JSONPath filters.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    value:
      high_risk_alerts: ${{ ACTIONS.list_alerts.result[?(@.risk_score > 5)] }}
    ```

</Tip>

<Accordion icon="book-open" title="Example">
For example, assume you receive the following list of alerts via webhook (e.g. `TRIGGER`):
```json
[
  { "id": "1", "severity_id": 1, "severity": "Low", "title": "Low severity alert" },
  { "id": "2", "severity_id": 2, "severity": "Medium", "title": "Medium severity alert" },
  { "id": "3", "severity_id": 3, "severity": "High", "title": "High severity alert" }
]
```

You can select all alerts with `severity_id` greater than 1:

```yaml
${{ TRIGGER[?(@.severity_id > 1)] }}
```

This will return the following list:
```json
[
  { "id": "3", "severity_id": 3, "severity": "High", "title": "High severity alert" }
]
```
</Accordion>

## Action loops

To apply the same action to each item in an array, you must configure at least one **Loop expression**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign variable">
    Under the **If condition / Loops** tab, assign each item in the array to a variable e.g. `var.alert`:

    ![Action loop](/img/platform/loop.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use variable">
    Call the declared variable in the action inputs:

    ![Use loops variable](/img/platform/loop-var.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filter and loop

You can first filter an array and then run the loop on the filtered array.

## Child workflow loops

Add the `Execute Child Workflow` action to the workflow.
Copy the workflow ID or alias from the child workflow and paste it into the action inputs.
Similar to action loops, you can configure the child workflow to run once per item in the array.

![Child workflow loops](/img/platform/child-workflow-loops.png)

You can also configure the `batch_size` to run the child workflow in batches.
This is useful if you want to limit the number of concurrent child workflow executions at a time.

## Inline functions

Tracecat comes with multiple functions that allow you to work with arrays. All functions must be called using the `FN` prefix within expressions.

### List transformations

- **flatten** - Flattens nested sequences
```yaml
${{ FN.flatten([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) }}
# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- **apply** - Apply a function to each item
```yaml
${{ FN.apply(["a", "b", "c"], "lambda x: f'prefix:{x}'") }}
# Result: ["prefix:a", "prefix:b", "prefix:c"]
```

- **map** - Alias for `apply`
```yaml
${{ FN.map(["a", "b", "c"], "lambda x: f'prefix:{x}'") }}
# Result: ["prefix:a", "prefix:b", "prefix:c"]
```

### List filtering

- **filter** - Filter items using a lambda function
```yaml
${{ FN.filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "lambda x: x > 3") }}
# Result: [4, 5]
```

- **unique** - Returns unique items
```yaml
${{ FN.unique([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) }}
# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
### Set operations

- **intersect** - Returns common elements between sequences
```yaml
${{ FN.intersect([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]) }}
# Result: [2, 3]

# With lambda function which is applied to each item
# in the first array before comparison with the second array
${{ FN.intersect([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], "lambda x: x + 1") }}
# Result: [3, 4]
```

- **difference** - Returns elements in first sequence not in second
```yaml
${{ FN.difference([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]) }}
# Result: [1, 2]

# With lambda function which is applied to each item
# in the first array before comparison with the second array
${{ FN.difference([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], "lambda x: x + 1") }}
# Result: [2, 3]
```

- **union** - Combines multiple sequences
```yaml
${{ FN.union([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]) }}
# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Advanced operations

- **zip** - Combine multiple sequences
```yaml
${{ FN.zip([1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"]) }}
# Result: [(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c")]
```

- **iter_product** - Generate cartesian product
```yaml
${{ FN.iter_product([1, 2], ["a", "b"]) }}
# Result: [(1, "a"), (1, "b"), (2, "a"), (2, "b")]
```
