title: User-Defined Functions
description: Build custom integrations with a single Python decorator
---

A User-Defined Function (UDF) is a custom function that you can use as an action in your workflows.
All Tracecat Actions use this underlying UDF framework to perform tasks.

## Motivations

- Automatically generate input/output validators for frontend actions through backend code.
- Provide a customizable and extensible framework for defining actions.

## Framework

We've developed a simple framework that takes UDFs and converts them into Temporal activities and UI action blocks.
The framework currently only supports using Python functions as UDFs.

### Registry

The `registry` singleton is a global Python object that stores all the decorated UDFs.
At runtime, Tracecat's workflow runner dynamically executes these functions according to the [workflow definition](/workflow-definition).

### API

In Tracecat, the way we create UDFs is by defining a Python function and decorating it with `@registry.register`.
In Python, we support using both synchronous and asynchronous functions. For example:

```python Example UDFs
import asyncio
from tracecat.registry import registry

@registry.register(
    description="Adds two numbers.",
    namespace="example",
)
def add(
    lhs: Annotated[int, Field(..., description="The first number")],
    rhs: Annotated[int, Field(..., description="The second number")],
) -> int:
    return lhs + rhs

@registry.register(
    description="Sleeps and subtracts two numbers.",
    namespace="example",
)
async def sleeping_subtract(
    lhs: Annotated[int, Field(..., description="The first number")],
    rhs: Annotated[int, Field(..., description="The second number")],
) -> int:
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return lhs - rhs
```

These UDFs will be registered under the `example` namespace, and their keys are `example.add` and `example.sleeping_subtract`.

The `register` decorator also accepts arbitrary keyword arguments that are stored in the registry.
We plan on using this to further extend the capabilities of UDFs, for example by using a `version` keyword argument to specify the version of the UDF.

### Secrets injection

You can declare a list of secrets in your UDFs using the `secrets` parameter.
You will have to create these secrets on the platform either through the `settings/credentials` UI or through the API/CLI.
The declared secrets are pulled from Tracecat's secret manager at runtime.

For example, given `my_secret` with key `MY_SECRET_KEY`:

```python Example UDF with a declared secret
@registry.register(
  description="This is a sample UDF with secrets",
  secrets=["my_secret"] # Accepts more than one secret name
)
async def requires_api_key(resource_name: str, value: int) -> str:
    # Call this normally like regular Python code!
    api_key = os.environ["MY_SECRET_KEY"]

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
          f"https://api.example.com/resource/{resource_name}",
          headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
          json={"value": value}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text
```

## Schemas

Tracecat performs schema validation on all inputs and outputs of actions.

### Schema Generation

- Tracecat UDFs automatically generate Pydantic models for input and output validation.

### Schema validation

Currently all input validation is performed on the server side using the registered UDF Pydantic validators.

### UI Generation

- Motivation: All dyanmic forms and schema validation should be driven by server-side code.
- UDFs can capture a lot more infromation through the `typing.Annotated` annotations and `registry.register` decorator.
- This information is used to generate extended JSONSchema that can be used to generate UI in our NextJS frontend.

_NOTE: This feature is currently a work in progress._
