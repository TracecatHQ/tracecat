title: Webhooks
description: Receive events from external events and trigger workflows.
---

Webhooks allow workflows to interact with external systems by listening for and responding to events.

## Overview

A workflow has only one webhook by design.
Each webhook exposes a unique URL endpoint to receive events from other systems and forward them entrypoints in Tracecat Workflows.

The webhook format is:

```bash
$TRACECAT__PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL/$WORKFLOW_ID/$WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

You can get this URL from the Trigger block in the UI, or by making a GET request to the API.
Using the CLI this would be:

```bash
tracecat workflow inspect $WORKFLOW_ID
```

## Filters

A webhook can be configured with filters.
A filter performs checks on incoming data or other factors to decide if a workflow should run.

Some benefits of using filters include the ability to:

- Ignore certain events from triggering a workflow
- Prevent a workflow from being executed if certain conditions are not met
- Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse or overloading the system (coming soon)
- Reject events that do not conform to some HTTP headers or other network security requirements (coming soon)
- Perform callbacks without scheduling a workflow (coming soon)

A filter is a set of conditions that must be satisfied before a workflow is executed.
Each condition is a [full expression](/concepts/expressions#full-templates) that returns a `boolean`.

```yaml example_filter.yaml
triggers:
  - type: webhook
    ref: my_webhook_with_filters
    filters:
      - kind: all # all conditions must be satisfied
        conditions:
          - ${{ FN.not_null(TRIGGER.value) }}
          - ${{ FN.equals(TRIGGER.value, "123456") }}
      - kind: any # any condition must be satisfied
        conditions:
          - ${{ FN.not_null(TRIGGER.value) }}
          - ${{ FN.contains([1, 2, 3], TRIGGER.value) }}
```

Filters are always evaluated in the order they are defined, and likewise for the conditions within each filter.
If no filters are configured, a webhook will simply always schedule a workflow for execution.

## Authentication

Our current webhook implementation uses a secret attached to the path to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.

<Note>
  We are migrating our webhook infrastructure to use [Svix](https://svix.com)
  for secure and resilient webhook delivery.
