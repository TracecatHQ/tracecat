Actions are individual tasks performed at each step of a Tracecat workflow.
You can find all available Actions in the workspace catalog (left sidebar).

## Core Actions

There are only 5 core action types, but they can be configured to perform almost any task.
For example, a [HTTP request](#action-types) can be configured to send a GET request to an API endpoint.
See [Quickstart](/quickstart) for a worked example.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="HTTP Request" icon="globe">
    Make HTTP requests to interact with external APIs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Transform" icon="code">
    Transform data in-flight.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send Email" icon="envelope">
    Send emails to specified recipients.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Actions" icon="robot">
    Perform AI-powered tasks (e.g. summarize, label, translate).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Case" icon="folder-open">
    Open and prepopulate a case in the case management system.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Extending Actions

Actions are built on top of our [user-defined functions](/concepts/user-defined-functions) (UDF) framework.
You can add your own UDFs if you self-host Tracecat and even change the core actions!

<Tip>
  In Tracecat enterprise, users will eventually be able to create their own
  private UDFs for any custom actions or integrations they wish to run.
</Tip>

## Control Flow

Every action manages its own control flow logic.

### Conditional logic

Every action has a `run_if` clause that can be used to conditionally run the action.
Any [full expression](/concepts/expressions#full-templates) that evaluates to a `boolean` can be passed to the `run_if` clause.

```yaml example_run_if.yaml
actions:
  - ref: check_virustotal
    action: core.http_request
    run_if: ${{ FNS.non_null(TRIGGER.hash) }} # TRIGGER.hash != null
    args:
      url: https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/${{ TRIGGER.hash }}
      method: GET
```

### Loops (WIP)

<Warning>
  This feature is still in the design phase, but we plan to support loops in the
  future.
</Warning>
Every action will have a `loop` clause that can be used to run the action multiple
times.

```yaml example_for_each.yaml
inputs:
  hashes:
    - "1234567890"
    - "0987654321"
    - "5678901234"
actions:
  - ref: check_virustotal
    action: core.http_request
    for_each: ${{ for ENV.curr_hash in INPUTS.hashes }} # Assigns each hash to ENV.curr_hash
    args:
      url: https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/${{ ENV.curr_hash }}
      method: GET
```

This will hit the urls:

- `https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/1234567890`
- `https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/0987654321`
- `https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/5678901234`
