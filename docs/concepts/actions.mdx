Actions are individual tasks performed at each step of a Tracecat workflow.
You can find all available Actions in the workspace catalog (left sidebar).

## Core Actions

There are only 5 core action types, but they can be configured to perform almost any task.
For example, a [HTTP request](#action-types) can be configured to send a GET request to an API endpoint.
See [Quickstart](/quickstart) for a worked example.
