A workflow is the more central Tracecat object.
It is a collection of actions that are executed in a specific order.
Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, such as a schedule or an external event.

Workflows can be expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### Modes of operation

1. **No-code mode**: You can interact with the workflow canvas to add, remove, and connect actions.
2. **Code mode**: You can use a YAML domain-specific language (DSL) to define and edit workflows.
