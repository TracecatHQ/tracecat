Secrets are crendentials that you can pull into your workflows to access APIs and tooling.

## Secret Types

We currently only support `custom` type secrets, where the encrypted credentials are a list of key-value pair JSON objects with only the keys `key` and `value`.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "custom",
  "name": "my_secret",
  "keys": [
    {
      "key": "SOME_API_KEY",
      "value": "SOME_SECRET_VALUE"
    },
    {
      "key": "ANOTHER_API_KEY",
      "value": "ANOTHER_SECRET_VALUE"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
We have planned support for other secret types like `oauth2`,  `token`.

## Just-In-Time Secrets Access

Tracecat's secret manager manages the lifecycle of secrets during execution.
We actively try to minimize secret exposure in the execution context and environment by making them available only at the time of execution.
When an action completes, Tracecat removes secrets from the execution context.

Secrets also use `pydantic.SecretStr` to ensure that the secrets are not accidentally logged or exposed in the UI/logs.

## Creating Secrets

You can create secrets using the Tracecat CLI or the API.

<CodeGroup>
```sh CLI
tracecat secrets create some_secret KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2
```

```sh curl
curl -X PUT $TRACECAT__API_URL/secrets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type":"custom",
    "name":"some_secret",
    "keys":[
      {
        "key":"KEY1",
        "value": "VALUE1"
      },
      {
        "key":"KEY2",
        "value": "VALUE2"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## API credentials for actions

You can add the following API keys using our built in secrets manager:

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup) (required for _AI actions_)
- [Resend API Key](https://resend.com/docs/introduction) (required for _Email actions_)

<Warning>These docs are a work in progress.</Warning>
