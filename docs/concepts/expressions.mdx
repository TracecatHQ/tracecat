description: Powerful templating language and formulas to manipulate data.
---

The concepts explained in this section are all very interdependent on one another, so we've added a [cheatsheet](/concepts/expressions#cheatsheet) to help you get started.

## Expressions Overview

Expressions are a powerful feature in Tracecat that gives you fine-grained control over your action logic.
They are strings that can be evaluated into a value or data/object reference, prefixed with a [context](#expression-contexts) and wrapped in [template](#template-syntax) `${{ ... }}` syntax.
We use [JSONPath](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-goessner-dispatch-jsonpath-00.html) expressions (dot notation) to access data, objects, or functions inside JSON-like data structures.

In object-oriented programming terms, you can think of this as method invocation or attribute access on a specific context (analagous to a class or instance).

Some examples of expressions:

```css
${{ SECRETS.my_secret.SUPER_SECRET }}
${{ ACTIONS.my_action.result }}
${{ FN.add(1, 2) }}
${{ INPUTS.my_input }}
${{ TRIGGER.my_trigger }}
```

<Note>
  Our convention is to use `lower_snake_case` if you need to replace whitespace
  in your paths.
</Note>

We also support **typecasting** for expressions:

```css
${{ <expression> -> <type> }}
```

Types we currently support are `int`, `str`, `bool`, and `float`.

For example, this expression will return the integer literal 3:

```css
${{ FN.add(1, 2) -> int }}
```

## Expression Contexts

An expression context is a top-level namespace that changes the behavior of an expression.
Tracecat expression contexts are all uppercase qualifiers, e.g. `SECRETS`.

We use dot notation or JSONPath expressions to access data, objects, or functions in a particular context.
We currently support the following contexts:

| Qualifier | Expression syntax                   | Description                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `SECRETS` | `SECRETS.<name>.<key>`              | Secrets manager                         |
| `ACTIONS` | `ACTIONS.<jsonpath>.result`         | The active workflow's execution results |
| `FN`      | `FN.<fn_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...)` | Inline functions                        |
| `INPUTS`  | `INPUTS.<jsonpath>`                 | The active workflow's static inputs     |
| `TRIGGER` | `TRIGGER.<jsonpath>`                | The active workflow's trigger inputs    |

## Template syntax

Tracecat's template syntax takes inspiration from Github Actions, so it may feel familiar to you!

A template is a string with a `${{ ... }}` pattern that wraps an expression:

```css
${{ <expression> }}
```

Templates can exist in two forms: full templates and inline templates.

### Full templates

A full template is a sstring that only contains a single template with no surrounding whitespace:

```php
"${{ ... }}"
```

It follow that when a full template wraps an expression, we call this a **full expression**:

```php
"${{ <expression> }}"
```

The final datatype of the above expression depends on the return type of the expression and whether there is a typecast.

This expression will return integer literal `3` because `FN.add(1, 2)` returns an integer:

```php
"${{ FN.add(1, 2) }}"
```

In contrast, this expression will return string literal `"3"` because `FN.add(1, 2)` was cast to a string:

```php
"${{ FN.add(1, 2) -> str}}"
```

In YAML, by convention we omit the quotes around full expressions:

```yaml
actions:
  - ref: my_action
    action: example.action
    args:
      value: ${{ FN.add(1, 2) }}
```

### Inline templates

An inline template is a string where all templates are in the string body:

```php
"An inline template ${{ ... }} looks ${{ ... }} like this."
```

As you'd expect, the following is called an **inline expression**:

```php
"An inline template ${{ <expression-1> }} looks ${{ <expression-2> }} like this."
```

The final datatype of the above expression is always a string.

For example, this expression:

```php
"An inline template ${{ FN.add(1, 2) }} looks ${{ FN.add(1, 2) -> str }} like this."
```

will return string literal `"An inline template 3 looks 3 like this."`:

In YAML, by convention we wrap quotes around inline expressions:

```yaml
actions:
  - ref: my_action
    action: example.action
    args:
      value: "An inline template ${{ FN.add(1, 2) }} looks ${{ FN.add(1, 2) -> str }} like this."
```

## Expression Types

### Action Expressions

Action expressions are JSONPaths that target the `ACTIONS` context. It references data or objects that are returned from completed actions.

```css
${{ ACTIONS.<jsonpath>.result }}
```

For example, if you have an action that was defined with the following [UDF](/concepts/user-defined-functions) in your workflow definition:

```python
@registry.register(namespace="example", description="Adds two numbers.")
def add(lhs: int, rhs: int) -> int:
    return lhs + rhs
```

and the following snippet of YAML in your workflow definition:

```yaml
actions:
  - ref: add_two_numbers
    action: example.add
    args:
      lhs: 1
      rhs: 2
```

Then anywhere else in your workflow definition and given `add_two_numbers` has completed, you can use the `ACTIONS.add_two_numbers.result` expression to access the result of the action.

Revisiting the example above, if you added another action to the same workflow:

```yaml
actions:
  - ref: add_two_numbers
    action: example.add
    args:
      lhs: 1
      rhs: 2
  - ref: add_three_numbers
    action: example.add
    depends_on:
      - add_two_numbers
    args:
      lhs: ${{ ACTIONS.add_two_numbers.result }} # This evaluates to 3!
      rhs: 3
```

you can use upstream computations in your downstream actions.

<Tip>
  Tracecat's workflow engine doesn't enforce that actions require hierarchical
  dependencies on other actions to use their results. So long an action in the
  same workflow is completed, another action can use its result.
</Tip>

Action expressions always contain the following predefined keys:

| Key               | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `result`          | Contains the action's result.                      |
| `result_typename` | The Python type annotation of the action's result. |

### Input Expressions

Input expressions are JSONPath expressions that target the `INPUTS` context.

```css
${{ INPUTS.<jsonpath> }}
```

Given the following static workflow inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  company: Tracecat
  url: https://tracecat.com
  contact:
    email: founders@tracecat.com
    location: San Francisco, CA
```

Some valid input expressions would look like:

```css
${{ INPUTS.company }}
${{ INPUTS.url }}
${{ INPUTS.contact.email -> str }}
${{ INPUTS.contact.location }}
```

### Trigger Expressions

Trigger expressions are JSONPath expressions that target the `TRIGGER` context.

```css
${{ TRIGGER.<jsonpath> }}
```

Given the following webhook call:

```sh
curl -X POST $WEBHOOK_URL -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "event_type": "update",
    "source": "http://data-source.com",
    "metadata": {
      "time":"Thursday, May 20th 11:40pm",
      "platform":"cool_platform"
    }
  }'
```

Some valid input expressions would look like:

```css
${{ TRIGGER.event_type }}
${{ TRIGGER.metadata.time }}
```

### Secret Expressions

Secret expressions are JSONPath expressions that target the `SECRETS` context.
They allow you to pull created secrets from the Secrets Manager at runtime.

```css
${{ SECRETS.<name>.<key> }}
```

Given the following secrets created like such:

```sh
curl -X PUT $TRACECAT__API_URL/secrets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type":"custom",
    "name":"some_secret",
    "keys":[
      {
        "key":"SOME_API_KEY",
        "value": "SOME_SECRET_VALUE"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

To use `SOME_SECRET_VALUE` in your workflow, you would use the following expression:

```css
${{ SECRETS.my_secret.SOME_API_KEY }}
```

For instance, to make an API call:

```yaml
actions:
  - ref: my_action
    action: core.http_request
    args:
      url: https://api.some-example.com
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer ${{ SECRETS.some_secret.SOME_API_KEY }}
        ...
```

### Function Expressions

Function expressions are expressions that target the `FN` context.

```css
${{ FN.<fn_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...) }}

```

Our syntax allows for nested expressions, so you can use the result of one function as an argument to another function:

```css
${{ FN.add(FN.add(1, 2), 3) }}
```

</Note>

### Typecasts

We support the following typecasts:
| Type | Python Type |
|-------|-------------|
| int | `int` |
| float | `float` |
| str | `str` |
| bool | Custom `bool` - true for any truthy value, `1`, or upper/lower case `true` |

You can perform a typecast on an expression like so:

<CodeGroup>
```php Inline
${{ int(<expression>) }}
```

```php Trailing
${{ <expression> -> int }}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Evaluation Procedure

Before an action runs, Tracecat performs the following steps to evaluate the expressions in the action:

1. Find all secrets that are declared in secret expressions
2. Pull these into the execution context
3. Evaluate all types of expressions in one pass

After doing the above it then proceeds to run the action's associated UDF.
