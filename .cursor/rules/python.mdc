- Always use python 3.11+ type hints. This means prefer using builtin types (e.g. `list`, `dict`, `set`) for type hints over the equivalent types from the `typing` module.
- Always follow the Google Python style guide
- Always put imports at the top of the file. Do not use scoped imports unless strictly necessary.
- All tests under `tests/unit` are actually integration tests. Do not use mocks. Test logic as closely as production as possible.
- Always use `uv run` to execute python and `pytest` in the CLI.
- Always use `uv pip install` to install pip packages.
